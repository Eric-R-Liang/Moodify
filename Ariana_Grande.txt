and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget

and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget
no i cant
as im layin down
with you every night
it still gets to me that you remain by my side
i aint sayin that im not deserving of you
but i was dreaming bigger than i ever knew when
i wished for living
in a fairy tale no malice and no lies
so baby oh

all the love you have to give is only mine
thats how i know
i cant be your only one
no i cant be your only one
cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget
no i cant
i cant be your only one
no i cant be your only one
cause you look twice as good as anyone i ever met
and your love is three times better
how could anyone forget
no i cant
be your only 1

theres no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
but we hold on hold on
i guess times wasting
tick tocking lip locking
how can we keep the feelings fresh
how do we zip lock it
wear your heart up on your sleeve
so watch out for pick pockets
i guess to go the distance
we might need to pit stop it
i know love can be a beach with no shore
i done count to ten lost my temper and went back to four
i know sometimes its hard to realize im the man that you need
i had a dream we branched out
started a family tree
and i feel like that everything we do is overdue
you ask why i love your mom so much
cause shes a older you
i wish that you were happy
i guess thats the one thing i should be providing
aint no number twos we both ones of ones
and we the oddest couple only human
except you you a goddess
only lying to you when i lie it down just being honest
when you start as friends its hard to say youre never going back
if im not the one then im the best mistake you ever had
break up make up
total waste of time
can we please make up
our minds
and stop acting like were blind
cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
stars fall and the world goes blind

i cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
and then it was clear
i cant deny i really miss him
to think that i was wrong
i guess you dont know what you got til its gone
pain is just a consequence of love
im saying sorry for the sake of us
he wasnt my everything til we were nothing
and its taking me a lot to say
but now that hes gone my heart is missing something
so its time i push my pride away
cause you are
you are my everything
you are my everything
i know youre not far but i still cant handle all the distance
youre travelling with my heart
i hope this is a temporary feeling
cause its too much to bear
without you and i know sorry aint the cure
if i cross your mind just know im yours
cause what we got is worth fighting for
cause you are
you werent my everything til we were nothing
and its taking me a lot to say
now that youre gone my heart is missing something
so its time i push my pride away
you are you are you are my everything
you are you are you are my everything
you are you are you are
you are you are you are my everything
center of attention once again
they dont understand
they dont understand no
then they try to tell me who i am
they dont understand
they dont understand no
you want a perfect picture to believe in
then you cant be looking for me then
i dont need to live by your rules
you dont control me
until youve walked a mile in my shoes
you dont know me
and i know i know i know you dont like it
you dont you dont you dont know where ive been
its my life so truth be told
i see you thinking
but theres just one thing
you think you know
but you dont have no
think you know me
but theres more to see my love
the same arguments time and time again
and you watched them all happen
but they dont understand
thinkin youre the reason that it ends
and he wont be back again
but they dont understand
you want a perfect picture to believe in
then you cant be looking for me then
i dont need to live by your rules
you dont control me
until youve walked a mile in my shoes
you dont know me
and i know i know i know you dont like it
you dont you dont you dont know where ive been
its my life so truth be told
you dont know me
the girl you see in photographs is only
a part of the one i am dont judge me
cause thats not reality and all i can be
is in love with who im becoming
think you know me but theres more to see my love
you think you know but you dont have no idea
i dont need to live by your rules
you dont control me
until youve walked a mile in my shoes
you dont know me
and i know i know i know you dont like it
you dont you dont you dont know where ive been
its my life so truth be told
i see you thinking
you dont know me
i dont need to live by your rules
you dont control me
until youve walked a mile in my shoes
you dont know me
and i know i know i know you dont like it
you dont you dont you dont know where ive been
its my life so truth be told
i see you thinking
but theres just one thing
and you think you know
