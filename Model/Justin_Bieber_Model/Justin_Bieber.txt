looking out the window
waiting for your headlights
to pull up in the driveway
its really coming down tonight
youre scared that i wont make it through the storm
you should be here with me safe and warm
ill be waiting under the mistletoe
while youre driving here through the winter snow
baby think of me if it helps to get you home
when the only gift that i really need
is to have your arms wrapped around me
baby think of me if it helps to get you home
home this christmas
pacing down the hallway
trying to fight the urge to call
i could almost hear a pindrop
cept for the clock on the wall
and im scared that you wont make it through the storm
you should be here with me safe and warm
ill be waiting under the mistletoe
while youre driving here through the winter snow
baby think of me if it helps to get you home
when the only gift that i really need
is to have your arms wrapped around me
baby think of me if it helps to get you home

waiting under the mistletoe
while youre driving here through the winter snow
baby think of me if it helps to get you home
when the only gift that i really need
is to have your arms wrapped around me

didnt see whats going on
but now i know
im better sleeping on my own
cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that im still holdin on to somethin
you should go and love yourself
for all the times that you made me feel small
i fell in love
now i feel nothin at all
i never felt so low and i was vulnerable
was i a fool to let you break down my walls
cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that im still holdin on to somethin
you should go and love yourself
cause if you like the way you look that much

blink of an eye no goodbye
i had a notion deep as the ocean

wishing i couldve just wash away away
prayed our love wasnt vain
who was to blame for all the pain for all the pain
if i wouldve known
if i wouldve known if i would have known it could have been you
if i had the chance if i had the chance id make us brand new
i never wanted to be—wanted to be your enemy no
but if i if i wouldve known
if i would have known it could have been you been you
the repercussions im missing your loving
haunts me tonight
the ghosts are alive
all of the memories
of serenity

hoping that somebody would slow down
praying for a miracle

relationship on a ski slope
avalanche comin down slow
do we have enough time to salvage this love
feels like a blizzard in april

put us both on blast
tearing each other down
