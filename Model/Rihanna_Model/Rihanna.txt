my soul is awry
without asking why

wish somebodyd tell me what she said

dont it mean i love you
te amo te amo
shes scared to breathe
i hold her hand i got no choice uh
pulled me out on the beach danced in the water
i start to leave
shes begging me and asking why its over
then she said te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
i told her no
she cried te amo
i told her im not gonna run away
but let me go
my soul is awry
without asking why
i said te amo
wish somebodyd tell me what she said
dont it mean i love you

dont it mean i love you
listen we can dance
but you gotta watch your hands
watch me all night
im moving through the light
because i understand
that we all need love
and im not afraid
to feel the love but i dont feel that way
then she said te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
i told her no
she cried te amo
i told her im not gonna run away

i love you
te amo te amo
dont it mean i love you
story of my life
searching for the right
but it keeps avoiding me
sorrow in my soul
cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company
hes more than a man
and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
the clouds are rolling in
because im gone again
and to him i just cant be true
and i know that he knows im unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying
i dont wanna do this anymore
i dont wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i dont wanna hurt him anymore
i dont wanna take away his life
i dont wanna be
a murderer
i feel it in the air
as im doing my hair
preparing for another date
a kiss upon my cheek
as he reluctantly
asks if im gonna be out late
i say i wont be long
just hanging with the girls
a lie i didnt have to tell
because we both know
where im about to go
and we know it very well
cause i know that he knows im unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying
i dont wanna do this anymore
i dont wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i dont wanna hurt him anymore
i dont wanna take away his life
i dont wanna be
a murderer
our love his trust
i might as well take a gun and put it to his head
get it over with
i dont wanna do this
anymore 
i dont wanna do this anymore
i dont wanna be the reason why
and every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
and i dont wanna hurt him anymore
i dont wanna take away his life
i dont wanna be
a murderer 
a murderer
no no no

kisses dont
no they dont
never dont lie
you can run if you want but you cant hide
telling you its the truth dont you ask why
kisses dont
no they dont
kisses dont lie
emotions come and go
who knows how the wind will blow
there so little in this world to trust in
seduce themselves with lies
some dont realize
they call it love but its really only lusting
so you see you and me
were getting close to the danger zone
show me how tell me now
should i stay or should i go
cause im caught between yes and no
cause when you kiss me
i feel everything that i been missing
i try to slow down but my heart wont listen
and its tearing me all up inside
and when you touch me
i feel a rush but im afraid that it might crush me
should i put my trust in something i dont trust in
i try to run but theres no place to hide
cause baby kisses dont lie
kisses dont
no they dont
never dont lie
you can run if you want but you cant hide
telling you its the truth dont you ask why
kisses dont
no they dont
kisses dont lie
you whisper in my ear
but are your words sincere
cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
you see im nobodys fool
i play by my own rules
so please think twice before you step into my life
so you see you and me
were getting close to the danger zone
show me how tell me now

ive been california wishing on these stars
for your heart for me
my california king
eye to eye
cheek to cheek
side by side
you were sleeping next to me
arm in arm
dusk to dawn
with the curtains drawn
and a little last night on these sheets
so how come when i reach out my fingers
it seems like more than distance between us
in this california king bed
were ten thousand miles apart
ive been california wishing on these stars
for your heart for me
my california king
just when i felt like giving up on us
you turned around and gave me one last touch
that made everything feel better
and even then my eyes got wetter
so confused wanna ask you if you love me
but i dont wanna seem so weak
maybe ive been california dreaming
in this california king bed
were ten thousand miles apart
been california wishing on these stars
for your heart for me
my california king
my california king
in this california king bed
were ten thousand miles apart
ive been california wishing on these stars
for your heart for me
my california king

maybe let them play it maybe itll save the world
they gonna miss hearing it when its gone

what if we left every moment that we could spare
and the perfect song ends up being the last song youll ever hear
youll never know when the songs gonna play
the last song youll hear is the one you made
your song was beautiful thats why i started singing it
but this song is our song
so its playing until the end even if its the last song

like a dance started slow and then love took control
swept away so proud to be your girl
when you write a story much to fast
sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last
now i know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
now i know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when its right its so amazing
when it’s wrong you gotta let it go
now i know
now i know
remember when we said our love would last forever
but then again how are we to know
there come a time that love will change like stormy weather
a sunny day will suddenly turn cold
time will teach you all you need to learn
but there’ll always be a first time you get burned
now i know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
now i know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when its right its so amazing
when it’s wrong you gotta let it go
now i know
now i know
i don’t regret a single day
joy and pain along the way
a broken heart’s the price we pay
as sad as it may seem
baby can’t you see
it’s the way it’s gotta be
now i know that love ain’t meant to be a play thing
now i know it’s not an ordinary everyday thing
now i know that when its right its so amazing
when it’s wrong you gotta let it go
now i know
now i know
now i know
mama i found a man
who loves me and understands
papa he’s quite a man
he adores me he’s my biggest fan
and dont get me wrong
i know he’s not perfect in your eyes
but somehow he’s flawless in mine
and you may tell me to run run now
but i cant do that
were too far down the hole
hes got a hold on my soul
so i guess im a fool
im a fool in love
but im willing to stay here
and bask in the glory of his heart
i guess im a fool in love
but im willing to look so stupid
till ive had enough
mama dont judge me now

i know this wont make you proud
papa did i let you down
are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out
youll see a monster
i see a smile

but im willing to stay here
and bask in the glory of his heart

stare at myself in the mirror
take me apart piece by piece
sorrow decrease
pressure release i put in work
did more than called upon more than deserved
when it was over did i wind up hurt 
but it taught me before a decision ask this question first
who am i living for
is this my limit
can i endure some more
chances are given question existing
who am i living for
is this my limit
can i endure some more
chances are given question existing
take off my coat
show them that under here
im just like you do the mistakes
i may make me a fool or a human with flaws
admit that im loss
round of applause
take the abuse
sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
its entertainment is that an excuse 
but the question that lingers whether win or lose
dear diary
its robyn
entertaining is something i do for a living
its not who i am id like to think that im pretty normal
i laugh i get mad i hurt i think
guys suck sometimes
but when youre in the spotlight
everything seems good
sometimes i feel like i have it worst cause i have to always keep my guard up
i dont know who to trust i dont know who wants to date me for who i am
or who wants to be my friend for who i really am
yellow diamonds in the light
and were standing side by side
as your shadow crosses mine
what it takes to come alive
its the way im feeling i just cant deny
but ive gotta let it go
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
shine a light through an open door
love and life i will divide
turn away cause i need you more
feel the heartbeat in my mind
its the way im feeling i just cant deny
but ive gotta let it go
we found love in a hopeless place

when we ride we ride
its til the day that we die
its real late
bout a quarter to 1
im thinking about everything weve become
and i hate it
i thought we could make it
but im ready to dead this
just wanna forget about it
i saw her pictures
and the letters she sent
you had me thinking
you were out we your friends
im so foolish
play me like im stupid
cause i thought it was just you and i 
now i look back on the time
that we spent and
i see it in my mind
playing over and over again
cause boy right now
you got me breaking down
and i just cant figure out why
but this is what you say
visions in my mind
of the day that we met
you showed me things
that ill never forget
took me swimming
in the ocean
you had my head up in the clouds
made me feel like im floating 
you think im playing
when you know its the truth
nobody else can do it
quite like i do
all my kisses
and my loving
but aint nobody
better than us
i guess its over
indefinitely
but you and i know
its not that easy
to let go
of everything 
everything
that we planned
and start all over again
just blame yourself cause you blew it
i wont forget how you do it
sweet baby
this is where the game ends now
somehow wanna believe you and me
we can figure it out
you finna make me say boy
i wish that you come hold me
when im lonely
when i need someone to talk to
you would phone me
just like everything you told me
boy you forgot about the promises
you made me
and now well let the memories
just fade away
but i remember
what you used to say
red lipstick rose petals heartbreak
i was his marilyn monroe
brown eyes tuxedo fast cars
a james dean on the low
dean on the low
i ask you whats the matter
you say oh its nothing at all
hearts racing outta control
and you knew that i couldnt let it go
you used to be this boy i loved
and i used to be this girl of your dreams
who knew the course of this one drive
injured us fatally
you took the best years of my life
i took the best years of your life
felt like love struck me in the night
i prayed that love dont strike twice
red lipstick rose petals heartbreak
i was his marilyn monroe
brown eyes tuxedo fast cars
a james dean on the low
whats love without tragedy
whats love without tragedy 
marilyn monroe
whats love without tragedy
whats love without tragedy

you got your boys and got gone
and left us all alone
now she in the club with a freaky dress on
cats dont want her to keep that dress on
trying to get enough drinks in her system
take it to the tele and make her a victim
patron on brain ball player in her face
they shake the spot shes just another case
easy for a good girl to go bad
and once we gone 
best believe weve gone forever
dont be the reason
dont be the reason
you better learn how to treat us right
cause once a good girl goes bad

hes staying with a flock of them oh yeah
got a girl at home but he dont care

all hell do is keep me at home wont let me go nowhere
he thinks because im at home i wont be getting it on
and now im finding numbers in the jacket pockets
tricks calling the house nonstop its getting out of control
finally i cant take no more
he finds a letter on the stairs saying this is the end
i packed my bag and left with your best friend
easy for a good girl to go bad
and once we gone 
best believe weve gone forever
dont be the reason
dont be the reason
you better learn how to treat us right
cause once a good girl goes bad
we done forever
we stay moving around solo
ask us where you at we dont know
and dont care 
dont care
all we know is we was at home cause you left us there
you got your boys and got gone
and left us all alone
easy for a good girl to go bad
and once we gone 
best believe weve gone forever

its been a minute since i saw you boy
must admit its good to hear your voice
and i guess that i forgot just how you make me feel when your around
see you havent lost your sense of style
and you still could melt me with your smile
cant deny that i still got these feelin deep inside
its funny how things could change
but still remain the same
isnt love just a crazy game
baby here i go again
i look into your eyes and then
my heart remembers when
and i realize i neva gotten over you
everytime i hear your name
its like the sun shined through the rain
and i realize its happening
baby here i go again
here i go again
still remember how you make me weak
how i fought to find the words to speak
i just cant excape the memories
i tried but i just cant break free
thought i closed the door on what we had
but these feelings just keep comin back
didnt think that you could make me loose control like that
sweet lovin is my ting
so you know mi got fi swing
thats why yuh request it again
without a doubt yuh want to spend
and to experience it again
because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
so make me light it up again
reignite the flames again
cause you really miss dem days when we used to chill
up on the hill watch the sun set in west nigril
girl yuh bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
not to mention the way you are within
sound of taking breath
take a breath
take it deep
calm yourself he says to me
if you play you play for keeps
take the gun and count to three
im sweating now
moving slow
no time to think
my turn to go
and you can see my heart beating
you can see it through my chest
said im terrified but im not leaving
i know that i must pass this test
so just pull the trigger 
say a prayer to yourself
he says close your eyes sometimes it helps
and then i get a scary thought
that hes here  means hes never lost
and you can see my heart beating
no you can see it through my chest
said im terrified but im not leaving
know that i must pass this test
so just pull the trigger
as my life flashes before my eyes
im wondering will i ever see another sunrise
so many wont get the chance to say goodbye
but its too late to think of the value of my life
and you can see my heart beating
no you can see it through my chest
said im terrified but im not leaving no
know that i must pass this test
you can see my heart beating
oh you can see it through my chest
im terrified but im not leaving no
know that i must pass this test
so just pull the trigger

the affliction of the feeling
leaves me wanting more
cause i may be bad
but im perfectly good at it

but chains and whips

i like it
i like it
i like it
i love the feeling
you bring to me
oh you turn me on
its exactly what
ive been yearning for
give it to me strong
and meet me in my boudoir
make my body say ah ah ah
i like it
cause i may be bad
but im perfectly good at it
sex in the air
i dont care
i love the smell of it
sticks and stones
may break my bones
but chains and whips
excite me
na na na na
i like it
i like it
i like it
i like it
here we lay face to face once again
silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
and im wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
were just holding on to could have beens and we should be letting go
it feels like youre a million miles away as youre lying here with me tonight
i cant even find the words to say i can find a way to make it right
and we both know that the storys ending
we play the part but were just pretending and i cant hide the tears
cause even though youre here
it feels like youre a million miles away
was it me or was it you that broke away
for what we were is like a season love is change
and every time i think about it it tears me up inside
like the rivers of emotion but i got no more tears to cry
we can try to talk it over but we walked that road before
while our song is playing its last note
we both know for sure that its time to close that door
we break break we break break we break break were breaking down 
its getting later baby and im getting curious
nobodys looking at us i feel delirious
cause the beat penetrates my body
shaking inside my bones
and you pushing all my buttons taking me outta my zone
the way that you stare starts a fire in me
come up to my room you sexy little thing
and lets play a game i wont be a tease
ill show you the room my sexy little thing
i wish you would push up on me
i wish you would push up on me
i wish you would light me up and say you want me
push up on me 
i know many guys just like ya extremely confident
got so much flavor with you like youre the perfect man
you wanna make me chase ya like its a compliment
but lets get right down to it
i could be the girl thatll break you down
we break break we break break we break break were breaking down 
i wanna see how you move
show me show me how you do it
you really got me on it i must confess
baby there aint nothing to it
baby who you think youre fooling
you wanna come get me outta my dress
thats how much i love you
thats how much i need you
and i cant stand you
must everything you do make me wanna smile
can i not like you for awhile
but you wont let me
you upset me girl
and then you kiss my lips
all of a sudden i forget
that i was upset
cant remember what you did
but i hate it
you know exactly what to do
so that i cant stay mad at you
for too long
thats wrong
but i hate it
you know exactly how to touch
so that i dont want to fuss
and fight no more
said i despise that i adore you
and i hate how much i love you boy
i cant stand how much i need you 
i need you
and i hate how much i love you boy
but i just cant let you go
and i hate that i love you so
and you completely know the power that you have
the only one that makes me laugh
said its not fair
how you take advantage of the fact
love you beyond the reason why
and it just aint right
and i hate how much i love you girl
i cant stand how much i need you
and i hate how much i love you girl
but i just cant let you go
but i hate that i love you so
one of these days maybe your magic wont affect me
and your kiss wont make me weak
but no one in this world knows me the way you know me
so youll probably always have a spell on me
thats how much i love you
how much i need you
thats how much i need you
how much i love you
thats how much i love you
how i need you
thats how much i need you
i need you
and i hate that i love you so
and i hate how much i love you boy
i cant stand how much i need you
and i hate how much i love you boy
but i just cant let you go
and i hate that i love you so
and i hate that i love you so so
