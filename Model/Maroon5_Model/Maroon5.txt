on the side of the highway baby
our road is long
your hold is strong
please dont ever let go oh no
i know i dont know you
but i want you so bad
everyone has a secret
but can they keep it
oh no they cant
im driving fast now
dont think i know how to go slow
where you at now
i feel around
there you are
cool these engines
calm these jets
i ask you how hot can it get
and as you wipe off beads of sweat
slowly you say im not there yet
its so hard to find you
im standing right behind you
the streets are much colder
this mean im getting older
why would you how could i
these questions lead to goodbye
but now i got my freedom
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday youll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a way to be alone
im terrified
i think that i may be losing my mind
shy girl so humble
with eyes that make me stumble
somehow not speaking lets me know everything
i go out you eat in
hot from the situation
youre naked in daylight
wrap yourself up and goodnight
im burning im hungry
angry cause she dont love me
you got me completely
in my own game you beat me
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday youll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a way to be alone
im terrified i think that i may be losing my mind
i will be back again
no this is not the end
ive fallen hard this time but im not giving in
i want the world to know
that i wont let you forget
the tears that you shed
ill make it impossible to let go
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday youll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a way to be alone
im terrified
i think that i may be losing my mind
i parked my car outside your house
hope that someday youll come home
seems the woman that i love
is someone that i hardly know
and after all this time
i finally found a place to be alone
im terrified
i think that i may be losing my mind
now as the summer fades
i let you slip away
you say im not your type
but i can make you sway
it makes you burn to learn
youre not the only one
id let you be if you
put down your blazing gun
now youve gone somewhere else far away
i dont know if i will find you 
find you find you
but you feel my breath on your neck
cant believe im right behind you 
right behind you
cause you keep me coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
if i never see your face again i dont mind
cause we gone much further than i thought wed get tonight
sometimes you move so well
its hard not to give in
im lost i cant tell
where you end and i begin
i wonder if hes half the lover that i am
now youve gone somewhere else far away
i dont know if i will find you 
find you find you
but you feel my breath on your neck
cant believe im right behind you 
right behind you
cause you keep me coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
if i never see your face again i dont mind
cause we gone much further than i thought wed get tonight
baby baby please believe me
find it in your heart to reach me
promise not to leave me behind
take me down but take it easy
make me think but dont deceive me
torture me by taking your time
cause you keep me coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
if i never see your face again i dont mind
cause we gone much further than i thought wed get tonight
cause you keep me coming back for more
and i feel a little better than i did before
if i never see your face again i dont mind
cause we gone much further than i thought wed get tonight
i wake up with bloodshot eyes
struggled to memorize
the way it felt between your thighs
pleasure that made you cry
feels so good to be bad
not worth the aftermath
after that after that
try to get you back
i still dont have a reason
and you dont have the time
and it really makes me wonder
if i ever gave a fuck about you
give me something to believe in
cause i dont believe in you anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference to try
so this is goodbye
god damn my spinning head
decisions that made my bed
now i must lay in it
and deal with things ive left unsaid
i want to dive into you
forget what youre going through
i get behind make your move
forget about the truth
i still dont have a reason
and you dont have the time
and it really makes me wonder
if i ever gave a fuck about you
give me something to believe in
cause i dont believe in you anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference
it even makes a difference to try
and you told me how youre feeling
but i dont believe its true anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
so this is goodbye
ive been here before
one day ill wake up
and it wont hurt anymore
you caught me in a lie
i have no alibi
the words you say dont have a meaning
i still dont have a reason
and you dont have the time
and it really makes me wonder
if i ever gave a fuck about you and i
and so this is goodbye
give me something to believe in
cause i dont believe in you anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference
it even makes a difference to try
and you told me how youre feeling
but i dont believe its true anymore anymore
i wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
so this is goodbye
so this is goodbye
so this is goodbye
so this is goodbye

steal some covers share some skin
clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable

she does not walk she runs instead
down these jagged streets and into my bed
when i was
fumbling through your dresser drawer forgot what i was looking for
try to guide me in the right direction
making use of all this time
keeping everything inside
close my eyes and listen to you cry
theres only so much i can do for you
after all of the things you put me through

im making your love
this citys made us crazy and we must get out
you left me hanging from a thread we once swung from together
ive licked my wounds but i cant ever see them getting better

her hair was pressed against her face her eyes were red with anger
enraged by things unsaid and empty beds and bad behavior
somethings gotta change

so goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight

the way it feels to be alive
the day that he first met her

after school walking home
fresh dirt under my fingernails
and i can smell hot asphalt
cars screech to a halt to let me pass
and i cannot remember
what life was like through photographs
and trying to recreate images life gives us from our past
and sometimes its a sad song
but i cannot forget
refuse to regret
so glad i met
you and take my breath away
make everyday
worth all of the pain
that i have gone through
and mama ive been cryin
cause things aint how they used to be
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles from the sun
moving on down my street
i see people i wont ever meet
think of her take a breath
feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
and sometimes its a sad song
but i cannot forget
refuse to regret
so glad i met
you and take my breath away
make everyday
worth all of the pain
that i have gone through
and mama ive been cryin
cause things aint how they used to be
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles from the sun
the rhythm of her conversation
the perfection of her creation
the sex she slipped into my coffee
the way she felt when she first saw me
hate to love and love to hate her
like a broken record player
back and forth and here and gone
and on and on and on and on
i cannot forget
refuse to regret
so glad i met
you and take my breath away
make everyday
worth all of the pain
that i have gone through
and mama ive been cryin
cause things aint how they used to be
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles—
she said the battles almost won
and were only several miles from the sun
how dare you say that my behaviours unacceptable
so condescending unnecessarily critical
i have the tendency of getting very physical
so watch your step cause if i do youll need a miracle
you drain me dry and make me wonder why im even here
this double vision i was seeing is finally clear
you want to stay but you know very well i want you gone
not fit to fuckin tread the ground that im walking on
when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
what you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
you should know better you never listened to a word i said
clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
hoping somebody someday will do you like i did
when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
does it kill
does it burn
is it painful to learn
that its me that has all the control
does it thrill
does it sting
when you feel what i bring
and you wish that you had me to hold
when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
woke up sweating from a dream
with a different kind of feeling
all day long my heart was beating
searching for the meaning
hazel eyes
i was so colorblind
we were just wasting time
for my whole life
we never crossed the line
only friends in my mind
but now i realize

cant believe i could not see it all this time all this time

now i know why my heart wasnt satisfied satisfied
it was always you you
no more guessing who

hazel eyes
i was so colorblind
we were just wasting time
for my whole life
we never crossed the line
only friends in my mind
but now i realize
it was always you
cant believe i could not see it all this time all this time
it was always you
now i know why my heart wasnt satisfied satisfied
it was always you you
no more guessing who
looking back now i know it was always you always you
you always you

best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
ill be damned cupids demanding back his arrow
so lets get drunk on our tears
and god tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
its hunting season and the lambs are on the run
searching for meaning
but are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark
who are we
just a speck of dust within the galaxy
woe is me
if were not careful turns into reality
but dont you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
yesterday i saw a lion kiss a deer
turn the page maybe well find a brand new ending
where were dancing in our tears
and god tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
its hunting season and the lambs are on the run
searching for meaning
but are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark
and i thought i saw you out there crying
and i thought i heard you call my name
and i thought i heard you out there crying
just the same
and god give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
its hunting season and this lamb is on the run
searching for meaning
but are we all lost stars trying to light 
light up the dark
and i thought i saw you out there crying
and i thought i heard you call my name
and i thought i heard you out there crying
but are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark
are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark
im full of regret
for all things that i have done and said
and i dont know if itll ever be okay to show
my face round here
sometimes i wonder if i disappear

infatuation
not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
its such a shame that you shot me down
it would have been nice to be around
im touching your skin
if its only a fantasy then why is it killing me
i guess this must be infatuation
try to put my finger on what burns me up
it always seems to escape me
and when you have decided that youve had enough
just tell me where i need to be
now im facing something that i never had
to ever deal with before
she left me with the feeling that shed had enough
and im the one wanting more
burn another bridge break another heart
try again it will only fall apart
infatuation
not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
its such a shame that you shot me down
it would have been nice to be around

im so attracted to you
the feelings mutual too

get so hot i forget to breathe yeah
infatuation
not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
its such a shame that you shot me down

do you wish you were somewhere else
justified all the things you tried
said that it was all for me
and be near
just for the moment
stay here
never go home
did you know that everything she ever does is for you
so it goes the story of a broken heart comes true

took the dive just to feel alive
but never heard the truth

if i fell in love with you
would you promise to be true

cause ive been in love before
and ive found that love was more
than just holding hands
if i give my heart to you
i must be sure from the very start
that you would love me more than her
if i trust in you
oh now please dont run and hide
if i love you too
oh please dont hurt my pride like her
cause i couldnt stand the pain
and i would be sad if our new love was in vain
so i hope youll see
that i would love to love you
and that she will cry
when she learns we are two
cause i couldnt stand the pain
and i would be sad if our new love was in vain
so i hope youll see
that i would love to love you
and that she will cry
when she learns we are two
if i fell in love with you yeah
can you see me
floating above your head
as you lay in bed
thinking about everything
that you did not do
cause saying i love you
has nothing to do with meaning it
and i dont trust you
cause every time youre here
your intentions are unclear
i spend every hour waiting for a phone call
that i know will never come
i used to think you were the one
now im sick of thinking anything at all
you aint ever coming back to me
and thats not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that
do you remember
the way we used to melt
do you remember how it felt
when i touched you
oh cause i remember very well
and how long has it been
since someone you let in
has given what i gave to you
and at night when you sleep
do you dream i would be there
just for a minute or two do you
you aint ever coming back to me
and thats not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that
heartache heartache i just have so much
a simple love with a complex touch
and there is nothing you can say or do
i called to let you know im through with you
you aint ever coming back to me
and thats not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that
heartache heartache i just have so much
a simple love with a complex touch
and there is nothing you can say or do
i called to let you know im through
i called to let you know im through
i called to let you know im through with you
i aint ever coming back to you
i watched you cry
bathed in sunlight
by the bathroom door
you said you wished you did not love me anymore
you left your flowers in the backseat of my car
the things we said and did have left permanent scars
obsessed depressed at the same time
i cant even walk in a straight line
ive been lying in the dark no sunshine
no sunshine
no sunshine
she cries
this is more than goodbye
when i look into your eyes
youre not even there
its just a feeling
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have oh yeah
cause i cant believe that its over
youve hit your low
youve lost control and you want me back
you may not believe me but i gave you all i had
undress confess that youre still mine
roll around in a bed full of tears
im still lying in the dark no sunshine
no sunshine
no sunshine
she cries
this is more than goodbye
when i look into your eyes
youre not even there
its just a feeling
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
no i cant believe that its over now
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
so much to say
its not the way she does her hair
its the way she seems to stare right through my eyes
and in my darkest day when she refused to run away
from love she tried so hard to save
its just a feeling
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
its just a feeling
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
just a feeling
just a feeling that i have
i cant believe that its over
i cant believe that its over
now i cant believe thats its over yeah
i was so high i did not recognize
the fire burning in her eyes
the chaos that controlled my mind
whispered goodbye she got on a plane
never to return again
but always in my heart
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
and i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore
i tried my best to feed her appetite
keep her coming every night
so hard to keep her satisfied
kept playing love like it was just a game
pretending to feel the same
then turn around and leave again
but i know
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
and i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore
ill fix these broken things
repair your broken wings
and make sure everythings alright
my pressure on your hips
sinking my fingertips
into every inch of you
cause i know thats what you want me to do
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
and i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and my heart is breaking in front of me
she said goodbye too many times before
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
and i have no choice cause i wont say goodbye anymore
i asked her to stay but she wouldnt listen
she left before i had the chance to say
the words that would mend the things that were broken
but now its far too late shes gone away
every night you cry yourself to sleep
thinking why does this happen to me
why does every moment have to be so hard
hard to believe it
its not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wont go home without you
the taste of her breath ill never get over
the noises that she made kept me awake
the weight of the things that remained unspoken
built up so much it crushed us everyday
every night you cry yourself to sleep
thinking why does this happen to me
why does every moment have to be so hard
hard to believe it
its not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wont go home without you
its not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wont go home without you
of all the things i felt but never really shown
perhaps the worst is that i ever let you go
i should not ever let you go oh oh oh
its not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wont go home without you
its not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wont go home without you
and i wont go home without you

when you get home
there must be someplace here that only you and i could go
so i can show you how i
dream away everyday

the rhythm of the rain that drops
and coincides with the beating of my heart
ill never leave you behind

give me the sweetest goodbye
that i ever ever ever did receive
pushing forward and arching back

you wont be getting my affection again oh no
i dont need you

no one cares about a name without a face
so dont go shooting up the place oh

cause the love ive got is deeper
so much deeper than you could ever feel
and i miss you i love you
its a shame you cant stay away from me this time oh no
you beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you
you wont be getting my affection again oh no
cause i dont need you tonight
it was really nice to know you
i got nothing left to show you
got bills to pay get out the way its time to move on
and dinner with your boyfriend
will never be the same again
discuss me over cigarettes and say to him

you beg me you ask me to kiss you and hug you

you beg me you ask me to kiss you hug you

so no no cause i wont need you
it is so easy to see
dysfunction between you and me
we must free up these tired souls
before the sadness kills us both
i tried and tried to let you know
i love you but im letting go
it may not last but i dont know
just dont know
if you dont know
then you cant care
and you show up
but youre not there
but im waiting
and you want to
still afraid that i will desert you
everyday
with every worthless word we get more far away
the distance between us makes it so hard to stay
but nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way
a bed thats warm with memories
can heal us temporarily
but misbehaving only makes
the ditch between us so damn deep
built a wall around my heart
i’ll never let it fall apart
strangely i wish secretly
it would fall down while im asleep
if you dont know
then you cant care
and you show up
but youre not there
but im waiting
and you want to
still afraid that i will desert you babe
everyday
with every worthless word we get more far away
the distance between us makes it so hard to stay
but nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way
though we have not hit the ground
it doesnt mean were not still falling
oh i want so bad to pick you up
but youre still too reluctant to accept my help
what a shame i hope you find somewhere to place the blame
but until then the fact remains
everyday
with every worthless word we get more far away
the distance between us makes it so hard to stay
nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way
everyday
with every worthless word we get more far away
the distance between us makes it so hard to stay
but nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
it hurts but it may be the only way
from the moment the lights went off
everything had changed
lie awake in an empty room
in my head it all feels the same
like the taste of the day you left
that still lingers on my breath
and the dampness of tears that left
a stain where you had wept
all alone with the negligee
that still hangs off of my bed
i keep meaning to give it away
but i just leave it there instead
no need to cry about it
i cannot live without it
every time i wind up back at your door
why do you do this to me
you penetrate right through me
every time i wind up back at your door
three more days til i see your face
im afraid its far too much
cook a meal and fix up the place
dial your number hang it up
if i took you for granted
i apologize for acting tough
youre my reason for living
and theres no way im giving up oh
no need to cry about it
i cannot live without it
every time i wind up back at your door
why do you do this to me
you penetrate right through me
every time i wind up back at your door
now every evening is a bitter fight
and im eating home alone on a friday night
and i know what your friends say
youre just wasting your love and time
i will never let you change your mind
no need to cry about it
i cannot live without it
every time i wind up back at your door
why do you do this to me
you penetrate right through me
every time i wind up back at your door
no need to cry about it
i may just die without it
every time i wind up back at your door
why do you do this to me
you penetrate right through me
every time i wind up back at your door
every time i wind up back at your door
every time i wind up back at your door
living easy lovin free

to love you so hard for so long
so much stronger than before
but so much harder to move on
and now the bitter chill of the winter
still blows through me like a plague
only to wake up with an empty bed
on a perfect summer day
my world just feels so cold
and you find yourself
walking down the wrong side of the road
i cant lie youre on my mind
stuck inside my head
i wanna feel your heart beat for me instead yeah
i just die so much inside
now that youre not there
i wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday
i never did my best to
express how i really felt
and now that i know exactly what i want

and you find yourself
walking on the wrong side of the road
i cant lie youre on my mind
stuck inside my head
i wanna feel your heart beat for me instead yeah
i just die so much inside
now that youre not there
i wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
my world just feels so cold
and i find myself
thinking about the things i could have done
and it warms my soul
when you let me know
im not the only one
i cant lie youre on my mind
stuck inside my head
i wanna feel your heart beat for me instead yeah
i just die so much inside
now that youre not there
i wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday
