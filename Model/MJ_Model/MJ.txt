shed be sitting here beside me
and my heart would then be whole
i hope to make a change now for the better
never letting fate control my soul

somebody killed little susie
the girl with the tune
who sings in the daytime at noon
she was there screaming
beating her voice in her doom
but nobody came to her soon
a fall down the stairs
her dress torn
oh the blood in her hair
a mystery so sullen in air
she lie there so tenderly
fashioned so slenderly
lift her with care
oh the blood in her hair
everyone came to see
the girl that now is dead
so blind stare the eyes in her head
and suddenly a voice from the crowd said
this girl lived in vain
her face bear such agony such strain
but only the man from next door
knew little susie and how he cried
as he reached down
to close susies eyes
she lie there so tenderly
fashioned so slenderly
lift her with care
oh the blood in her hair
it was all for gods sake
for her singing the tune
for someone to feel her despair
to be damned to know hoping is dead and youre doomed
then to scream out
and nobodys there
she knew no one cared
father left home poor mother died
leaving susie alone
grandfathers soul too had flown
no one to care
just to love her
how much can one bear
rejecting the needs in her prayers
neglection can kill
like a knife in your soul
oh it will
little susie fought so hard to live
she lie there so tenderly
fashioned so slenderly
lift her with care
so young and so fair
go on girl

but we still can change some things today
in our small way

here one day
gone one night
like a sunset
dying with the rising of the moon
gone too soon
gone too soon
another day has gone

shes out of my life
shes out of my life
and i dont know whether to laugh or cry
i dont know whether to live or die
and it cuts like a knife
shes out of my life
its out of my hands
its out of my hands
to think for two years she was here
and i took her for granted i was so cavalier
now the way that it stands
shes out of my hands
so ive learned that loves not possession
and ive learned that love wont wait
now ive learned that love needs expression
but i learned too late
shes out of my life
shes out of my life
damned indecision and cursed pride
kept my love for her locked deep inside
and it cuts like a knife
shes out of my life
as i drove across on the highway
my jeep began to rock
i didnt know what to do so i stopped and got out and looked down i noticed ive got a flat
so i walked out parked the car like sideways

i felt a strange feeling like a mist so
i walked down towards the end of the road
and in the fog a woman appeared
she said dont you worry my friend ill take care take my hand ill take you there

take me to a place without no name 
without no name
as she took me right through the fog
i seen beautiful city appear

she turned around looked down at my eyes and they started crying and grabbed my hand youve got a friend

she started liking me kissing me and hugging me
she didnt really really want me to leave
she showed me places ive never seen and things ive never done this really looks like a lot of fun
ive seen the grass and the skies and the birds and the flowers surrounded by the trees
this place is filled with love and happiness how in the world could i wanna leave
so then i went in my pocket took my wallet on out

your love is magical thats how i feel
but i have not the words here to explain
gone is the grace for expressions of passion
but there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
to tell you how i feel
but i am speechless speechless
thats how you make me feel
though im with you i am far away
and nothing is for real
when im with you i am lost for words
i dont know what to say
my heads spinning like a carousel
so silently i pray
helpless and hopeless
thats how i feel inside
nothings real but all is possible
if god is on my side
when im with you i am in the light where i cannot be found
its as though i am standing in the place called hallowed ground
speechless speechless
thats how you make me feel
though im with you i am far away
and nothing is for real
ill go anywhere
and do anything
just to touch your face
theres no mountain high
i cannot climb
im humbled in your grace
speechless speechless
thats how you make me feel
though im with you i am lost for words
and nothing is for real
speechless speechless
thats how you make me feel
though im with you i am lost for words
and nothing is for real
speechless speechless
thats how you make me feel
though im with you i am lost for words
and nothing is for real
speechless
your love is magical thats how i feel
but in your presence i am lost for words
words like—like i love you
smile though your heart is aching
smile even though its breaking
when there are clouds in the sky
youll get by
if you smile
with your fear and sorrow
smile and maybe tomorrow
youll find that life is still worthwhile 
if you just
light up your face with gladness
hide every trace of sadness
although a tear may be ever so near
thats the time you must keep on trying
smile whats the use of crying
youll find that life is still worthwhile
if you just
smile though your heart is aching
smile even though its breaking
when there are clouds in the sky
youll get by
if you smile
through your fear and sorrow
smile and maybe tomorrow
youll find that life is still worthwhile
if you just smile
thats the time you must keep on trying
smile whats the use of crying
youll find that life is still worthwhile
if you just smile

well my only fear

please dont disappear
stay awhile oh
cinderella stay awhile
dont you go
alone she lays waiting
surrounded by gloom
invaded by shadows
painting the room
the light from the window
cuts through the air
and pins the child lying there
scared of the moon
she pulls up the covers
and shivers in fright
she hides from the color
that rides on the night
the light through the window
that lights up the sky
and causes her mournful cry
scared of the moon
theres nothing wrong
dont be bothered they said
its just childish fantasies turning your head
no need to worry
its really too soon
but there she lies shivering
scared of the moon
scared of the moon
scared of the moon
scared of the moon
scared of the moon
the years go by swiftly
and soon childhood ends
but life is still fearful
when evening descends
the fear of a child
still intrudes the night
returning on beams of light
scared of the moon
the feeling of terror
she felt as a youth
has turned from a fantasy
into the truth
the moon is the enemy
twisting her soul
and taking its fearful toll
scared of the moon
but now there are others who sit in a room
and wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
together they gather
their lunacy shade
but knowing just why theyre scared
scared of the moon
scared of the moon
scared of the moon
scared of the moon
scared of the moon

kremlins shadow belittlin me

how does it feel
when youre alone
and youre cold inside
here abandoned in my fame
armageddon of the brain

happy days will drown the pain
on and on and on it came
and again and again and again
take my name and just let me be

deceitful eyes shes got those come get me thighs
she only knows how low that she can go
she speaks the lines that can control my mind
wherever she goes i know my eyes follow
she blew a kiss i swear that it was meant
only for me then spoke with her body
her only goal is just to take control
and i cant believe that i cant tell her no
that girl i cant take her
should have known she was a heartbreaker
that girl i cant take her
should have seen right through her shes a heartbreaker
that girl i cant take her
should have seen it coming heartbreaker
that girl i cant take her
should have seen right through her
shes a heartbreaker
she plays a game with such an innocent face
i didnt know heartbreaking was her case
her actions confess and put me through the test
i was surprised that i was caught inside
now shes thinking that i will never know
and shell keep playing until i let her go
but i hope in time that she will finally realize
im onto her game and shell get played the same
i never thought that i would stop dreamin about you
stop being without you
but everyone told me so to stop caring about you
and start being without you
but ill find a way to go and start doin without you
and stop talkin about you
and what will she say
she will say i was the man that got away
youre not like anybody i ever knew
but that dont mean that i dont know where we are
and though i find myself attracted to you
this time im trying not to go too far cause
no matter how it starts it ends the same
someones always doing someone more
trading in the passion for that taste of pain
its only gonna happen again
its the fallin in love thats makin me high
its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
its the fallin in love thats makin me high
its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
all night
all night
and though im trying not to look in your eyes
each time i do they kind of burn right through me
dont want to lay down in a bed full of lies
and yet my heart is saying come and do me
now were just a web of mystery
a possibility of more to come
id rather leave the fantasy of what might be
but here i go falling again
its the fallin in love thats makin me high
its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry 
its the fallin in love thats makin me high 
its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry 
its the fallin in love thats makin me high 
its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry 
its the fallin in love thats makin me high 
its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry

its the fallin in love thats makin me high
its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
its the fallin in love thats makin me high
its the being in love that makes me cry cry cry

anytime she goes away
ill plant you a garden
of laughter and tears
with rain and with sunshine
love will grow through the years
the dreams that were dreaming
have time to come true
cause weve got forever
and forever is meant for so very few
we shall have music
we shal have rhyme
we shall have each other
one minute after the end of time
then well add up the pleasures
and treasure the sums
caring is sharing
the cake and the crumbs
how lucky we are to be me and you
cause weve got forever
and forever is meant for so very few
looking in my mirror

a thousand times and why
i played the fool for you
and still you said goodbye
if i let her get away
then the world will
have to see

singing a rock and roll hymn

healthly and clean
cant understand anyone having the blues

a broken bottle top
and a one mans soul

im asking him to change his ways
and no message could have been any clearer
if you wanna make the world a better place
take a look at yourself and then make a change
ive been a victim of
a selfish kind of love
its time that i realize
that there are some with no home
not a nickel to loan
could it be really me
pretending that theyre not alone
a willow deeply scarred
somebodys broken heart
and a washedout dream
they follow the pattern of the wind
cause they got no place to be
thats why im starting with me
im starting with the man in the mirror
im asking him to change his ways
and no message could have been any clearer
if you wanna make the world a better place
take a look at yourself and then make a change

tonights story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
a monster had arrived in the village
the major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
and this person or thing is soon to be met
he knows every thought he can feel every emotion
oh yes i did forget something didnt i i forgot to introduce you to the monster
youre fearing me cause you know im a beast
watching you when you sleep when youre in bed
im underneath
youre trapped in halls and my face is the walls
im the floor when you fall and when you scream its cause of me
im the living dead the dark thoughts in your head
i heard just what you said
thats why youve got to be threatened by me
you should be watching me you should feel threatened
while you sleep while you creep you should be threatened
every time your lady speaks she speaks of me threatened
half of me youll never be so you should feel threatened by me
you think youre by yourself but its my touch you felt
im not a ghost from hell but ive got a spell on you
your worst nightmare its me im everywhere
in one blink ill disappear and then ill come back to haunt you
im telling you when you lie under a tomb
im the one watching you
thats why you got to be threatened by me
the unknown monster is about to embark
from a far corner out of the dark
a nightmare thats the case
never neverland thats the place
this particular monster can read minds
be in two places at the same time
this is judgment night execution slaughter
the devil ghosts this monster is torture
you can be sure of one thing thats fate
a human presence that you feel is strange
a monster that you can see disappear
a monster the worst thing to fear
what you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
its the beginning
the way she came into the place
i knew right then and there
there was something different about this girl
the way she moved
her hair her face her lines
divinity in motion
as she stalked the room
i could feel the aura of her presence
every head turned feeling passion and lust
the girl was persuasive
the girl i could not trust
the girl was bad
the girl was dangerous
i never knew but i was walking the line
come go with me
i said i have no time
and dont you pretend we didnt talk on the phone
my baby cried
she left me standing alone
shes so dangerous
the girl is so dangerous
take away my money
throw away my time
you can call me honey
but youre no damn good for me
she came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
i fell trapped into her web of sin
a touch a kiss a whisper of love
i was at the point of no return
deep in the darkness of passions insanity
i felt taken by lusts strange inhumanity
this girl was persuasive
this girl i could not trust
the girl was bad
the girl was dangerous
i never knew but i was living in vain
she called my house
she said you know my name
and dont you pretend you never did me before
with tears in her eyes
my baby walked out the door
shes so dangerous
the girl is so dangerous
take away my money
throw away my time
you can call me honey
but youre no damn good for me
dangerous
the girl is so dangerous
i have to pray to god
cause i know how lust can blind
its a passion in my soul
but youre no damn lover friend of mine
i cannot sleep alone at night
my baby left me here tonight
i cannot cope til its all right
you and your manipulation
you hurt my baby
and then it happened
she touched me
for the lips of a strange woman
drop as a honeycomb
and her mouth was smoother than oil
but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a twoedged sword
but i loved it cause its dangerous
dangerous
the girl is so dangerous
take away my money
throw away my time
you can call me honey
but youre no damn good for me
dangerous

have you seen my childhood
im searching for the world that i come from
cause ive been looking around
in the lost and found of my heart
no one understands me
they view it as such strange eccentricities
cause i keep kidding around
like a child but pardon me
people say im not okay
cause i love such elementary things
its been my fate to compensate
for the childhood
ive never known
have you seen my childhood
im searching for that wonder in my youth
like pirates in adventurous dreams
of conquest and kings on the throne
before you judge me try hard to love me
look within your heart then ask
have you seen my childhood
people say im strange that way
cause i love such elementary things
its been my fate to compensate
for the childhood ive never known
have you seen my childhood
im searching for that wonder in my youth
like fantastical stories to share
the dreams i would dare watch me fly
before you judge me try hard to love me
the painful youth ive had
have you seen my childhood
love is here
and oh my darling now youre gone
love is here
and oh my darling now youre gone
you persuaded me to love you
and i did
but instead of tendeness
i found heartache instead
into your arms i fell
so unaware of the lonelyness
thar was waiting there
you closed the door to your heart girl
and you turned the key
locked your love away from me
love is here
and oh my darling now youre gone
you made me love you
and oh my darling now youre gone
you said loving you
would make life beautiful
with each passing day
but as soon as love came
into my heart
you turned and you walked
just walked away
you stripped me of my dreams
you gave me faith then you took my hope
look at me now
look at me
see what loving has done to me
look at my face
see how cryin has left its trace
after you made me all your own
then you left me all alone
you made your words sound so sweet
knowing that your love i couldnt keep
my heart cries out for your tuch
but baby youre not there
and the lonely cry fades in the air
love is here
and oh my darling now youre gone
love is here
and oh my darling now youre gone
you made me love you
oh oh my darling now youre gone
talking bout love love love love
ooh ooh my darling now youre gone
you are there like the laughter of a child 
when i need just a smile
suddenly the sun shines for a while 
everywhere sounds of love are everywhere
and my heart sings along 
thanks to you i finally got a song 
cause you are there 
you are there
you are there somewhere
each time my world seems like its falling down 
things look up just having you around
so every night i say a prayer
just because youre there
like a rainbow after rain
like the night follows day
youre the answer to the prayers i say 
and you are there 
you are there
you are there somewhere
no matter where i go or what i do
you are there to help me see it trough 
so every night i say a prayer 
just because youre there
ouuh you are there 
oooh you are there somewhere
and as the years go by well stay as true 
what you are for me ill be for you
and every night ill say a prayer 
just because youre there 
oooh you are there 
oooh you are there 
everywhere you are there

with a friend to call my own

shes from a world
of popcorn and candy
pony rides for a dime
little children laughing
im from a world
of disappointments and confusions
but i want her to be mine
i started talking
she kept on walking
she disappeared into the crowd
i lost my heart
on the carousel
to a circus girl
who left my heart in pieces
lost my heart
on the carousel
to a circus girl
who ran away
i was the clown
and she was the dancer
we both knew it wouldnt work
but we took our chances
what i cant recall
is if there was a girl at all
or was it my imagination
i still remember
all of those faces
and now all i have is memories
i lost my heart
on the carousel
to a circus girl
who left my heart in pieces
lost my heart
on the carousel
to a circus girl
who ran away
two different people
in love for an instant
to see that the circus came today
sometimes i can hear the calliope
and i can hear her calling me
dont you know
i lost my heart
on the carousel
to a circus girl
who left my heart in pieces
lost my heart
on the carousel
to a circus girl
who ran away

love was taken from a young life
and no one told her why
her direction has a dimelight
from one more violent crime
she innocently questioned why
why her father had to die
she asked the men in blue
how is it that you get to choose
who will live and who will die
did god say that you could decide
you saw he didnt run
and that my daddy had no gun
in the middle of a village
way in a distant land
lies a poor boy with his broken toy
too young to understand
hes awaken ground is shakin
his father grabs his hand
screaming crying his wifes dying
now hes left to explain
he innocently questioned why
why his mother had to die
what did these soldiers come here for
if theyre for peace why is there war
did god say that they could decide
who will live and who will die
all my mama ever did
was try to take care of her kids
were innocently standing by
watching people lose their lives
it seems as if we have no voice
its time for us to make a choice
only god could decide
who will live and who will die
theres nothing that cant be done
if we raise our voice as one
theyve gotta hear it from me
theyve gotta hear it from you
theyve gotta hear it from us
we cant take it
weve already had enough
theyve gotta hear it from me
theyve gotta hear it from you

we cant take it
weve already had enough
theyve gotta hear it from me
theyve gotta hear it from you
theyve gotta hear it from you baby
we cant take it
weve already had enough
deep in my soul baby
deep in your soul and let god decide
deep in my soul
its up to me and im still alive
theyve gotta hear it from us
we cant take it
weve already had enough
its going down baby
just let god decide
its going on baby

deep in my soul baby
weve already had enough
theyve gotta hear it from me
