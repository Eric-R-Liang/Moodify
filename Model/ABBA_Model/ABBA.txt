why it had to end this way

just another town another train
waiting in the morning rain
lord give my restless soul a little patience
just another town another train
nothing lost and nothing gained
guess i will spend my life in railway stations
guess i will spend my life in railway stations
when you wake i know youll cry
and the words i wrote to say goodbye
they wont comfort you at all
but in time you will understand
that the dreams we dreamed were made of sand
for a nogood bum like me
to live is to be free
just another town another train
waiting in the morning rain
look in my restless soul a little patience
just another town another train
nothing lost and nothing gained
guess i will spend my life in railway stations
guess i will spend my life in railway stations

im missing all the fun
baby you owe me one
aha un hum
its my turn to run
a chance to see the sun

end of night a new day dawning
and the first birds start to sing
in the pale light of the morning
nothings worth remembering
its a dream its out of reach
scattered driftwood on the beach
summer night city
summer night city
waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark
summer night city
walking in the moonlight lovemaking in the park
summer night city
in the sun i feel like sleeping
i cant take it for too long
my impatience slowly creeping
up my spine and growing strong
i know whats waiting there for me
tonight im loose and fancyfree
when the night comes with the action
i just know its time to go
cant resist the strange attraction
from that giant dynamo
lots to take and lots to give
time to breathe and time to live
waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark
summer night city
walking in the moonlight lovemaking in the park
summer night city
its elusive call it glitter
somehow something turns me on
some folks only see the litter
we dont miss them when theyre gone
i love the feeling in the air
my kind of people everywhere
when the night comes with the action
i just know its time to go
cant resist the strange attraction
from that giant dynamo
and tomorrow when its dawning
and the first birds start to sing
in the pale light of the morning
nothings worth remembering
its a dream its out of reach
scattered driftwood on a beach
waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark
summer night city
walking in the moonlight lovemaking in the park
summer night city
waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark
summer night city
walking in the moonlight lovemaking in the park
summer night city
waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark
summer night city
walking in the moonlight lovemaking in the park
summer night city
summer night city
summer night city
summer night city
summer night city
summer night city
lovemaking
summer night city
summer night city
waiting for the sunrise
summer night city
walking in the moonlight
summer night city

every day in the morning on her way to the office
you can see as she catches a train
just a face among a million faces
just another woman with no name
not the girl youd remember but shes still something special
if you knew her i am sure youd agree
cause i know shes got a little secret
friday evening she turns out to be
nina pretty ballerina
now she is the queen of the dancing floor
this is the moment shes waited for
just like cinderella
nina pretty ballerina
who would ever think she could be this way
this is the part that she likes to play
but she knows the fun would go away
if she would play it every day
so shes back every morning to her work at the office
and another week to live in a dream
and another row of early mornings
in an almost neverending stream
doesnt talk very often kind of shy and uncertain
everybody seems to think shes a bore
but they wouldnt know her little secret
what her friday night would have in store
nina pretty ballerina
now she is the queen of the dancing floor
this is the moment shes waited for
just like cinderella
nina pretty ballerina
who would ever think she could be this way
this is the part that she likes to play
she would like to play it every day
nina pretty ballerina
now she is the queen of the dancing floor
this is the moment shes waited for
just like cinderella
nina pretty ballerina
who would ever think she could be this way
this is the part that she likes to play
tried to sneak out without saying
with my loudest record playing
ooh my mama said look at this you havent done your bed
my mama said thats a thing that you should do instead
yeah i did what she had told me
dying for my friend to hold me
ooh my mama said try and get one thing into your head
my mama said pa and me we give you room and bed
how i wanna live my life
wanna live my life
lalala lalala life
in the morning she said listen
ooh i felt like in a prison
yeah my mama said i know youve been out again with fred
my mama said dont you lie your cheeks are blushing red
oh i wanna live my life
wanna live my life
lalala lalala life
i said i can live without him
how i wish you wouldnt doubt him
oh oh my mama said if you want to hurt me go ahead
my mama said i suppose youd rather see me dead
oh i wanna live my life
wanna live my life
lalala lalala life
lalala lalala life
lalala lalala life
lalala lalala life
did you see that man in the limousine
with the pretty doll he is fifty and the girls only seventeen
but she doesnt care and she never will
if hes ninetyfive she dont give a damn
just as long as he pays the bill
did you see that man with a fat cigar
he just left his lovers with a belly full of lobster and caviar
he can choose the wine from a vintage year
he will drink champagne in his limousine
where the rest of the street can peer
cause hes the man in the middle never second fiddle
just like a spider in a cobweb
hard as a hammer not the kind of boss you doublecross
cause hes the man in the middle knows the way to diddle
hes never bothered by his conscience
deals with the devil cause he wants to be
man in the middle the middle the middle
in the middle 
in the middle in the middle
but you see that man made a big mistake
even though hes got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
and the money too all that he can spend
he can buy the most nearly anything
but he cant buy the lot his friend
cause hes the man in the middle never second fiddle
just like a spider in a cobweb
hard as a hammer not the kind of boss you doublecross
cause hes the man in the middle knows the way to diddle
hes never bothered by his conscience
deals with the devil cause he wants to be
man in the middle the middle the middle
in the middle 
in the middle in the middle
por los dos brindo aquí
la cuenta se salgó
lo que fue calidez
el frio invadió
a vez al pasar tu y yo
migramos con el sol
hacia un verano nuevo
sin oscuridad
hoy que todo terminó
no hay a quien culpar
somos dos que ayer
vivimos soledad
nuestra unión se quebró
con toda dignidad
aun buscamos cielo azúl
en nuestro caminar
gracias por un gran amor
y la felicidad
hoy que todo terminó
no hay a quien culpar
bien se da que al caer
hay posibilidad
de surgir otra vez
y ver la realidad
todo claro al final
no hay nada por probar
en el cruce del camino
solo un nuevo andar
hoy que todo terminó
no hay a quien culpar
down in the street theyre all singing and shouting
staying alive though the city is dead
hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
while you are crying alone in your bed
pity cassandra that no one believed you
but then again you were lost from the start
now we must suffer and sell our secrets
bargain playing smart aching in our hearts
sorry cassandra i misunderstood
now the last day is dawning
some of us wanted but none of us could
listen to words of warning
but on the darkest of nights
nobody knew how to fight
and we were caught in our sleep
sorry cassandra i didnt believe
you really had the power
i only saw it as dreams you would weave
until the final hour
so in the morning your ship will be sailing
now that your father and sister are gone
there is no reason for you to linger
youre grieving deeply but still moving on
you know the future is casting a shadow
no one else sees it but you know your fate
packing your bags being slow and thorough
knowing though youre late that ship is sure to wait
sorry cassandra i misunderstood
now the last day is dawning
some of us wanted but none of us could
listen to words of warning
but on the darkest of nights
nobody knew how to fight
and we were caught in our sleep
sorry cassandra i didnt believe
you really had the power
i only saw it as dreams you would weave
until the final hour
i watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise
sails almost slack in the cool morning rain
she stood on deck just a tiny figure
rigid and restrained blue eyes filled with pain
sorry cassandra i misunderstood
now the last day is dawning
some of us wanted but none of us could
listen to words of warning
but on the darkest of nights
nobody knew how to fight
and we were caught in our sleep
sorry cassandra i didnt believe
you really had the power
i only saw it as dreams you would weave
until the final hour
im sorry cassandra
im sorry cassandra
where is the spring and the summer
that once was yours and mine
where did it go 
i just dont know
but still my love for you will live forever
hasta manana til we meet again
dont know where dont know when

well find a way to face a new tomorrow
hasta manana say well meet again

time to forget send me a letter

and all the nights we shared
where did they go 
i just dont know
and i cant tell you just how much i miss you
hasta manana til we meet again

darling our love was much too strong to die
well find a way to face a new tomorrow

time to forget send me a letter

hasta manana say well meet again
i cant do without you
time to forget send me a letter
say you forgive the sooner the better
hasta manana baby hasta manana until then
schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning
waving goodbye with an absentminded smile
i watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness
and i have to sit down for a while
the feeling that im losing her forever
and without really entering her world
im glad whenever i can share her laughter
that funny little girl
slipping through my fingers all the time
i try to capture every minute
the feeling in it
slipping through my fingers all the time
do i really see whats in her mind
each time i think im close to knowing
she keeps on growing
slipping through my fingers all the time
sleep in our eyes her and me at the breakfast table
barely awake i let precious time go by
then when shes gone theres that odd melancholy feeling
and a sense of guilt i cant deny
what happened to the wonderful adventures
the places i had planned for us to go
well some of that we did but most we didnt
and why i just dont know
slipping through my fingers all the time
i try to capture every minute
the feeling in it
slipping through my fingers all the time
do i really see whats in her mind
each time i think im close to knowing
she keeps on growing
slipping through my fingers all the time
sometimes i wish that i could freeze the picture
and save it from the funny tricks of time
slipping through my fingers
slipping through my fingers all the time
schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning
waving goodbye with an absentminded smile
rock me give me that kick now
rock me show me that trick now

i dont wanna talk
about things weve gone through
though its hurting me
now its history
ive played all my cards
and thats what youve done too
nothing more to say
no more ace to play
the winner takes it all
the losers standing small
beside the victory
thats her destiny
i was in your arms
thinking i belonged there
i figured it made sense
building me a fence
building me a home
thinking id be strong there
but i was a fool
playing by the rules
the gods may throw a dice
their minds as cold as ice
and someone way down here
loses someone dear
the winner takes it all
the loser has to fall
its simple and its plain
why should i complain
but tell me does she kiss
like i used to kiss you
does it feel the same
when she calls your name
somewhere deep inside
you must know i miss you
but what can i say
rules must be obeyed
the judges will decide
the likes of me abide
spectators of the show
always staying low
the game is on again
a lover or a friend
a big thing or a small
the winner takes it all
i dont wanna talk
if it makes you feel sad
and i understand
youve come to shake my hand
i apologize
if it makes you feel bad
seeing me so tense
no selfconfidence
but you see
the winner takes it all
the winner takes it all
so the winner takes it all
and the loser has to fall
throw a dice cold as ice
way down here someone dear
takes it all has to fall
it seems plain to me
long awaited darkness falls
casting shadows on the walls
in the twilight hour i am alone
sitting near the fireplace dying embers warm my face
in this peaceful solitude
all the outside world subdued
everything comes back to me again
in the gloom
like an angel passing through my room
half awake and half in dreams
seeing long forgotten scenes
so the present runs into the past
now and then become entwined playing games within my mind
like the embers as they die
love was one prolonged goodbye
and it all comes back to me tonight
in the gloom
like an angel passing through my room
i close my eyes
and my twilight images go by
all too soon
like an angel passing through my room
well there was me and bobby and bobbys brother
please take me back to that place
where ive got all my memories those were my happiest days
i remember all the games we used to play
i really do
and i went to see them almost every day
i wanted to
though we quarrelled at times
and had a few fights
we were the best of friends
we found a place in the sun
to have enough fun
well there was me and bobby and bobbys brother
wildest kids you could see
we would play together
climbing the apple tree
yes there was me and bobby and bobbys brother
please take me back to that place
where ive got all me my memories those were my happiest days
they would take me out for football games and such
they liked to play
and i guess i didnt like it very much
but anyway
i was happy and proud to be with the boys
being a little girl
i found a place in the sun
to have enough fun
well there was me and bobby and bobbys brother
wildest kids you could see
we would play together
climbing the apple tree
yes there was me and bobby and bobbys brother
please take me back to that place
where ive got all me my memories those were my happiest days
well there was me and bobby and bobbys brother
please take me back to that place
where ive got all my memories those were my happiest days
where ive got all my memories those were my happiest days
where ive got all my memories those were my happiest days
they say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul
a voyager ad a settler they both have a distant goal
if i explore the heavens or if i search inside
well it really doesnt matter as long as i can tell myself
ive always tried
like a roller in the ocean life is motion
like a wind thats always blowing life is flowing
like the sunrise in the morning life is dawning
how i treasure every minute
being part of it being in it
with the urge to move on
ive travelled every country ive travelled in my mind
it seems were on a journey a trip through space and time
and somewhere lies the answer
to all the questions why
what really makes the difference
between all dead and living things the will to stay alive
like a roller in the ocean 
la la la la la lala
life is motion 
la la la la la lala
move on 
la la la lala
like a wind thats always blowing 
la la la la la lala
life is flowing 
la la la la la lala

move on 
la la la lala
how i treasure every minute 
la la la la
being part of it 
la la la la
being in it 
la la la la
with the urge to move on
the morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea
the crying of the seagulls that hover over me
i see it and i hear it
but how can i explain
the wonder of the moment
to be alive to feel the sun that follows every rain
like a roller in the ocean 
la la la la la lala
life is motion 
la la la la la lala
move on 
la la la lala
like a wind thats always blowing 
la la la la la lala
life is flowing 
la la la la la lala

being part of it 
la la la laah
being in it
with the urge to move on
la la la la la lala la la la la la lala la la la lala
like a wind thats always blowing
la la la la la lala
la la la la la lala 
life is flowing

when you were lonely you needed a man
someone to lean on well i understand
its only natural
but why did it have to be me
nights can be empty nights can be cold
so you were looking for someone to hold
thats only natural
but why did it have to be me
i was so lonesome i was blue
i couldnt help it it had to be you and i
always thought you knew the reason why
i only wanted a little love affair
now i can see you are beginning to care
but baby believe me
its better to forget me
men are the toys in the game that you play
when you get tired you throw them away
thats only natural
but why did it have to be me
falling in love with a woman like you
happens so quickly theres nothing to do
its only natural
but why did it have to be me
i was so lonesome i was blue
i couldnt help it it had to be you and i
always thought you knew the reason why
i only wanted a little love affair
now i can see you are beginning to care
but baby believe me
its better to forget me
heres to us
one more toast and then well pay the bill
deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
birds of passage you and me
we fly instinctively
when the summers over and the dark clouds hide the sun
neither you nor im to blame when all is said and done
in our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
were still striving for the sky
no taste for humble pie
thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
neither you nor im to blame when all is said and done
its so strange when youre down and lying on the floor
how you rise shake your head get up and ask for more
clearheaded and openeyed with nothing left untried
standing calmly at the crossroads no desire to run
theres no hurry anymore when all is said and done
standing calmly at the crossroads no desire to run
theres no hurry anymore when all is said and done

and now i know what they mean

oh you make me dizzy
honey honey how you thrill me
no smiles not a single word at the breakfast table
though i would have liked to begin
so much that i wanna say but i feel unable
you leave and slam the door
like youve done many times before
and i cry and i feel so helpless
one man one woman
two friends and two true lovers
somehow well help each other through the hard times
one man one woman
one life to live together
one chance to take that never comes back again
you and me to the end
outside i can see the sun through the open window
inside everything feels so cold
whats wrong what is happening where did all our love go
sometimes when i just cant cope
i cling to a desperate hope
and i cry and i feel like dying
one man one woman
two friends and two true lovers
somehow well help each other through the hard times
one man one woman
one life to live together
one chance to take that never comes back again
you and me to the end
daydreams of a better life but i have to wake up
the sound of the key in the door
you smile and i realise that we need a shakeup
our love is a precious thing
worth the pain and the suffering
and its never too late for changing
one man one woman
two friends and two true lovers
somehow well help each other through the hard times
one man one woman
one life to live together
one chance to take that never comes back again
you and me to the end
you and me to the end
they came from the hills
and they came from the valleys and the plains
they struggled in the cold
in the heat and the snow and in the rain
came to hear him play
play their minds away
were all following a strange melody
were all summoned by a tune
were following the piper
and we dance beneath the moon
were following the piper
and we dance beneath the moon for him
and we dance beneath the moon
sub luna saltamus
they came from the south
from the west and the north and from the east
they waited for the man
like a parish is waiting for the priest
longed to hear him play
play their minds away
were all following a strange melody
were all summoned by a tune
were following the piper
and we dance beneath the moon
were following the piper
and we dance beneath the moon for him
and we dance beneath the moon
sub luna saltamus
he gave them a dream
he seduced everybody in the land
the fire in his eyes
and the fear was a weapon in his hand
so they let him play
play their minds away
were all following a strange melody
were all summoned by a tune
were following the piper
and we dance beneath the moon
were following the piper
and we dance beneath the moon for him
and we dance beneath the moon
they passed me by all of those great romances
you were i felt robbing me of my rightful chances
my picture clear everything seemed so easy
and so i dealt you the blow
one of us had to go
now its different i want you to know
one of us is crying
one of us is lying
in her lonely bed
staring at the ceiling
wishing she was somewhere else instead
one of us is lonely
one of us is only
waiting for a call
sorry for herself feeling stupid feeling small
wishing she had never left at all
i saw myself as a concealed attraction
i felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
just like a child stubborn and misconceiving
thats how i started the show
one of us had to go
now ive changed and i want you to know
one of us is crying
one of us is lying
in her lonely bed
staring at the ceiling
wishing she was somewhere else instead
one of us is lonely
one of us is only
waiting for a call
sorry for herself feeling stupid feeling small
wishing she had never left at all
never left at all
staring at the ceiling
wishing she was somewhere else instead
one of us is lonely
one of us is only
waiting for a call
he stands towering over me beside my bed
losing his head
tells me i must take him seriously
droning on the usual way
hes such a clever guy
and i wonder should i laugh or cry
dressed 
in the striped pajamas that i bought
trousers too short
of his small philosophy
carries on the way he does
and me i get so tired
and i wonder should i laugh or cry
high and mighty his banner flies
a fools pride in his eyes
standin there on his toes to grow in size
all i see is a big balloon
halfway up to the moon
hes wrapped up in the warm and safe cocoon
of an eternal lie
so should i laugh or cry
strange 
dangerously indifferent i have grown
cold as a stone
pain where there was pain before
far away he rambles on i feel my throat go dry
and i wonder should i laugh or cry
high and mighty his banner flies
a fools pride in his eyes
standin there on his toes to grow in size
all i see is a big balloon
halfway up to the moon
hes wrapped up in a warm and safe cocoon
of an eternal lie
so should i laugh or cry
you say shes been mad at you
then you say youll be patient ooh
still i see that she makes you blue
come on ill give you consolation

youre all i ever need my darling
and i would love to sing my lovesong
im hearing images im seeing songs
no poet has ever painted
voices call out to me straight to my heart
so strange yet were so well acquainted
i let the music speak with no restraints
i let my feelings take over
carry my soul away into the world
where beauty meets the darkness of the day
where my mind is like an open window
where the high and healing winds blow
from my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
i let them take me
let it be a joke
let it be a smile
let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
let it be a tear
let it be a sigh
coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry
some streets are emptiness dry leaves of autumn
rustling down an old alley
and in the dead of night i find myself
a blind man in some ancient valley
i let the music speak leading me gently
urging me like a lover
leading me all the way
into a place
where beauty will defeat the darkest day
where im one with every grand illusion
no disturbance no intrusion
where i let the wistful sounds seduce me
i let them use me
let it be a joke
let it be a smile
let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
let it be a tear
let it be a sigh
coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry
let it be a tear
let it be a sigh
coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry
let it be the joy of each new sunrise
or the moment when a day dies
i surrender without reservation
no explanations
no questions why
i take it to me and let it flow through me
yes i let the music speak
i let the music speak
ive seen it on your face
tells me more than any wornout old phrase
so now well go separate ways
never again we two
never again nothing i can do
like an image passing by my love my life
in the mirror of your eyes my love my life
i can see it all so clearly
answer me sincerely
was it a dream a lie
like reflections of your mind my love my life
are the words you try to find my love my life
but i know i dont possess you
so go away god bless you
you are still my love and my life
still my one and only
ive watched you look away
tell me is it really so hard to say
oh this has been my longest day
sitting here close to you
knowing that maybe tonight were through
like an image passing by my love my life
in the mirror of your eyes my love my life
i can see it all so clearly
answer me sincerely
was it a dream a lie
like reflections of your mind my love my life
are the words you try to find my love my life
but i know i dont possess you

yes i am to myself what jekyll must have been to hyde

ahhaha ahaaaah
ahhaha ahaaaah
ahhaha keep thinking bout his angeleyes
i keep thinking aaaah
last night i was taking a walk along the river
and i saw him together with a young girl
and the look that he gave her made me shiver
cause he always used to look at me that way
and i thought maybe i should walk right up to her and say
ahhaha its a game he likes to play
look into his angeleyes
one look and youre hypnotized
hell take your heart and you must pay the price
look into his angeleyes
youll think youre in paradise
and one day youll find out he wears a disguise
dont look too deep into those angeleyes
oh no no no no
ahhaha ahaaaah
ahhaha ahaaaah
ahhaha keep thinking bout his angeleyes
i keep thinking aaaah
sometimes when im lonely i sit and think about him
and it hurts to remember all the good times
when i thought i could never live without him
and i wonder does it have to be the same
every time when i see him will it bring back all the pain
ahhaha how can i forget that name
look into his angeleyes
one look and youre hypnotized
hell take your heart and you must pay the price
look into his angeleyes
youll think youre in paradise
and one day youll find out he wears a disguise
dont look too deep into his angeleyes
crazy bout his angeleyes
angeleyes
once he took my heart and now i pay the price
look into his angeleyes
youll think youre in paradise
and one day youll find out he wears a disguise
dont look too deep into those angeleyes
oh no no no no
ahhaha ahaaaah
ahhaha ahaaaah
ahhaha keep thinking ahaaaah
keep thinking bout his angeleyes
ahhaha keep thinking ahaaaah
keep thinking i had to pay the price
put on your white sombrero
saddle your horse my dear
and ride off into the sunset
youd better go
for there is no
place for you here
like an old fashoned hero
you stand before me
you think our life is a movie
my world is real
i live and feel
and i can do without you
put on your white sombrero
your red bandana too
think of this day as a showdown
goodbye my friend
this is the end
for me and you
now be a bold vaquero
dont show your feelings
ill cry while youre disappearing
into the night
all dressed in white
unchained and free without me
put on your white sombrero
like all the comboys do
go find a sweet senorita
somebody meek
wholl never speak
harshly to you
youre such a caballero
proud never bending
i want someone who will take me
just as i am
i need a man
who is in rhyme
with his time
youll never take me
just as i am
i need a man
who is in rhyme
with his time
el reloj
ya marcó medíanoche
y otra vez encontré
que tan solo me acompaña la tv
el soplar
de ese viento afuera
vive la desolación
me oprime con angustia el corazón
no hay más que soledad
nadie ni por piedad
dame dame dame
amor esta noche
alguien que me ayude
a las sombras borrar
dame dame dame
amor esta noche
hasta que amanezca
ver el día aclarar
tantos hay
con gran suerte y fortuna
todo pueden conseguir
tan distinto a lo que tengo que vivir
aburrida me encuentro esta noche
y la gran oscuridad
es mi siempre obligada amistad
no hay más que soledad
nadie ni por piedad
dame dame dame
amor esta noche
alguien que me ayude
a las sombras borrar
dame dame dame
amor esta noche
hasta que amanezca
ver el día aclarar
dame dame dame
amor esta noche
dame dame dame
amor esta noche
no hay más que soledad
nadie ni por piedad
dame dame dame
amor esta noche
alguien que me ayude
a las sombras borrar
dame dame dame
amor esta noche
hasta que amanezca
ver el día aclarar
dame dame dame
amor esta noche
alguien que me ayude
a las sombras borrar
dame dame dame
amor esta noche
hasta que amanezca
ver el día aclarar
he had what you might call a trivial occupation
he cleaned the platforms of the local railway station
with no romance in his life
sometimes he wished he had a wife
he read the matrimonial advertising pages
the cries for help from different people different ages
but they had nothing to say
at least not until the day
when something special he read

he called the number and a voice said alice whiting
the voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting
he was amazed at his luck
the purest streak of gold hed struck
he said i read your ad it sounded rather thrilling
i think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling
why dont we meet for a chat
the three of us in my flat
i cant forget what i read
this is what it said
if you dream of the girl for you
then call us and get two for the price of one
were the answer if you feel blue
so call us and get two for the price of one
if you dream of the girl for you
then call us and get two for the price of one

im an eagle that rides on the breeze
high high what a feeling to fly
over mountains and forests and seas
and to go anywhere that i please
as all good friends we talk all night and we fly wing to wing
i have questions and they know everything
theres no limit to what i feel we climb higher and higher
am i dreaming or is it all real
is it true im an eagle

i was a fighter always looking for trouble
and my life was so empty there was nothing left to live for
but then it happened one night as i got into a fight
i could hear someone saying as though he was praying
ahaahaaaahah
treat him well he is your brother
you might need his help some day
we depend on one another
love him thats the only way
on the road 
on the road
that were going
we all need 
we all need
words of comfort and compassion
treat him well he is your brother
love him thats the only way
i was a woman never thinking of others
and my life was so lonely didnt care for anybody
but then i happened to meet a begging man in the street
as i turned down his praying i heard someone saying
ahaahaaaahah
treat him well he is your brother 
you might need his help one day 
hes your brother
we depend on one another 
love him thats the only way
on the road 
on the road
that were going 
that were going
we all need 
we all need
words of comfort and compassion
treat him well he is your brother 
love him thats the only way
treat him well he is your brother 
you might need his help one day 
hes your brother
we depend on one another 
love him thats the only way
ive always hated my room its so gloomy and dreary
always the dark for the windows just face the back yard
so i cant understand how its happened how everythings changing
this old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter

maybe even when youre not there
the lovelight
everything around you is lovelight
youre shining like a star in the night
i wont let you out of my sight
i dont want to lose you i dont want to lose your lovelight

and i waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
and the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
when you came into my life it all got so much brighter
you must have a lovelight
everything around you is lovelight
and i can feel your love everywhere
maybe even when youre not there
the lovelight
everything around you is lovelight
youre shining like a star in the night
i wont let you out of my sight
i dont want to lose you i dont want to lose your lovelight
and i feel so good
and i feel so right
and i know that you must have a lovelight

and i can feel your love everywhere
maybe even when youre not there

everything around you is lovelight
youre shining like a star in the night
i wont let you out of my sight
i dont want to lose you i dont want to lose your lovelight
everything about you is right
let it glow and let it be bright
i dont want to lose your lovelight
shining like a star in the night

i was out for the morning sun
couldnt sleep so i thought id take a walk
i was thinking of you and me
and i went to your house cos i had to talk
i could hardly believe my eyes
when i saw this guy closing your front door
had a feeling of emptiness
like ive never had before
and i close my eyes
will you leave me girl
and i realise
its a crazy world
as he disappeared in his car
i was stunned and i didnt know what to do
everything i had ever been
everything in my lifes a part of you
and i just couldnt move my feet
so i stood on the pavement as you came out
you acted as you didnt know
what it was all about
and i close my eyes
will you leave me girl
and i realise
its a crazy world
baby how could you do it
you just told me lies
had you been behind my back with other guys
baby how could you tell me
there was only me
i was stupid to believe you
i was blind but now i see
then you smiled and you took my hand
there is something you said that you may not know
theres a couple of men in my life
and one of them is my brother joe
hes been gone for a long long time
but hes back and i think hes gonna stay
youll be seeing a lot of him
hes so nice in every way
and i close my eyes
never leave me girl
and i realise
its a crazy world
so i close my eyes
never leave me girl
then i realise
its a crazy world
i saw it in the mirror i saw it in my face
that im no longer needed anyone can take my place
i saw it in the mirror when i look into my eyes
cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries
i saw it in the mirror my head is hanging low
and i aint too familiar with the feelings that i show
i know you say you love me but im seeing through your lies
it doesnt really bother you if this boy cries
i never thought i could cry for you
but honey i will miss you til the day i die
i saw it in the mirror i saw it in my face
that im no longer needed anyone can take my place
i saw it in the mirror when i look into my eyes
cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries
i wasnt jealous before we met
now every woman i see is a potential threat
and im possessive it isnt nice
youve heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
but now it isnt true
now everything is new
and all ive learned
has overturned
i beg of you
dont go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
it was like shooting a sitting duck
a little small talk a smile and baby i was stuck
i still dont know what youve done with me
a grownup woman should never fall so easily
i feel a kind of fear
when i dont have you near
unsatisfied
i skip my pride
i beg you dear
dont go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
dont go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me
ive had a few little love affairs
they didnt last very long and theyve been pretty scarce
i used to think that was sensible
it makes the truth even more incomprehensible
cause everything is new
and everything is you
and all ive learned
has overturned
what can i do
dont go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
dont go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me
dont go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
dont go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me
dont go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me

pero hay un talento en mi singular
y es que la gente me escucha al cantar

que con la musica vale vivir
por eso quiero dar las gracias
por este don en mi

must have left my house at eight because i always do
my train im certain left the station just when it was due
i must have read the morning paper going into town
and having gotten through the editorial no doubt i must have frowned
i must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
with letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
i must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
the usual place the usual bunch
and still on top of this im pretty sure it must have rained
the day before you came
i must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
and at the time i never even noticed i was blue
i must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
without really knowing anything i hid a part of me away
at five i must have left theres no exception to the rule
a matter of routine ive done it ever since i finished school
the train back home again
undoubtedly i must have read the evening paper then
oh yes im sure my life was well within its usual frame
the day before you came
must have opened my front door at eight oclock or so
and stopped along the way to buy some chinese food to go
im sure i had my dinner watching something on tv
theres not i think a single episode of dallas that i didnt see
i must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
i need a lot of sleep and so i like to be in bed by then
i must have read a while
the latest one by marilyn french or something in that style
its funny but i had no sense of living without aim
the day before you came
and turning out the light
i must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
and rattling on the roof i must have heard the sound of rain
the day before you came
do i hear what i think im hearin
do i see the signs i think i see
or is this just fantasy
is it true that the beast is wakin
stirrin in his restless sleep tonight in the pale moonlight
in the grip of this cold december
you and i have reason to remember
soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
the songs that you and i dont sing
they blow their horns and march along
they drum their drums and look so strong
youd think that nothin in the world was wrong
soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
the songs that you and i wont sing
lets not look the other way takin a chance
cause if the bugler starts to play
we too must dance
whats that sound whats that dreadful rumble
wont somebody tell me what i hear
in the distance but drawin near
is it only a storm approachin
all that thunder and the blinding light in the winter night
in the grip of this cold december
you and i have reason to remember
soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
the songs that you and i dont sing
they blow their horns and march along
they drum their drums and look so strong
youd think that nothin in the world was wrong
soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
the songs that you and i wont sing
lets not look the other way takin a chance
cause if the bugler starts to play
we too must dance
soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing
the songs that you and i wont sing
lets not look the other way takin a chance
cause if the bugler starts to play
we too must dance
making somebody happy is a question of give and take
you can learn how to show it so come on give yourself a break
every smile and every little touch
dont you know that they mean so much
sweet sweet kisses so tender
always will return to sender
like a bang a boomaboomerang
dumbedumdum bedumbedumdum
oh bang a boomaboomerang
love is a tune you humdehumhum
so give it away i think youll learn
youll get love in return
so bang a boomaboomerang is love
a boomaboomerang is love
love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
when you feel that youve found it my advice is to take good care
never use it as a selfish tool
never ever be such a fool
every feeling youre showing
is a boomerang youre throwing
yes a bang a boomaboomerang
dumbedumdum bedumbedumdum
oh bang a boomaboomerang
love is a tune you humdehumhum
so give it away i think youll learn
youll get love in return
so bang a boomaboomerang is love
and if youre warm and tender
ill kiss you return to sender
please surrender
bang a boomaboomerang
dumbedumdum bedumbedumdum
oh bang a boomaboomerang is love

travelling up the nile
putting themselves on test
didnt that help the rest

i am just a girl one among the others nothing much to say
plain and simple girl not a special type in any way
just one look and you will surely see
that the true miss nobody is me
its an evil world that has only made me a girl
i am just a girl not the kind of woman men would like to meet
just another girl noone ever looks at in the street
but today i cant believe its true
when you smiled and whispered i love you
darling i could see i was meant to be your girl
its a funny feeling when you get to love someone
and thinking that hell never look your way
but then he says he loves you and life has just begun
its so much more than any words can say
i am just a girl not the kind of woman men would like to meet
just another girl noone ever looks at in the street
but today i cant believe its true
when you smiled and whispered i love you
darling i could see i was meant to be your girl
la la la la la la la la la lala la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la la lala la la laaa
but today i cant believe its true
when you smiled and whispered i love you
darling i could see i was meant to be your girl

se dice que el ansioso
esconde un alma en paz
viajero misionero
va lejos mucho más
si miro hasta el cielo
o dentro mío no sé
ya nada importa mucho
si puedo con sinceridad
saber que lo intenté
como el mar y su creciente
va la gente al andar
como el viento y su corrida
va la vida al andar
como el sol a la mañana
que reclama el andar
atesoro el momento
vivo y siento
es mi intento
y lo hago al andar
viajé por tantos lados
en la imaginación
estamos siempre andando
sin tiempo ni razón
quién sabe las respuestas
quién puede elegir
si existen diferencias
sabemos que hay en cada ser
deseos de vivir
como el mar y su creciente
va la gente al andar
como el viento y su corrida
va la vida al andar
como el sol a la mañana
que reclama el andar
atesoro el momento
vivo y siento
es mi intento
y lo hago al andar
la brisa que acaricia
con suavidad el mar
y todas las gaviotas
que vuelan sin cesar
lo veo y lo siento
y no lo sé explicar
espléndido momento
sentir llover
y el sol nacer
vivir y disfrutar
como el mar y su creciente
va la gente al andar
como el viento y su corrida
va la vida al andar
como el sol a la mañana
que reclama el andar
atesoro el momento
vivo y siento
es mi intento
y lo hago al andar
como el viento y su corrida
va la vida al andar
como el sol a la mañana
que reclama el andar
atesoro el momento
vivo y siento
es mi intento
y lo hago al andar
como el viento y su corrida
va la vida al andar
como el sol a la mañana

suzy was nine and i was ten
right at the time when boys like to think theyre men
she used to follow us at school
we really thought that she was a little fool
and one day we said to her
we dont want to hurt you girl
but youd better
look for a friend of your own suzyhangaround
better come back when youre grown suzyhangaround
nobody wants you around here and thats for sure
so get off our playground and stay away
thats all that weve got to say
suzyhangaround
suzy went home to mamas arms
mama said look shes never done you no harm
so get off her back and let her be
why cant you play together in harmony
we really didnt know what to say
but as soon as she went away
we laughed and said
look for a friend of your own suzyhangaround
better come back when youre grown suzyhangaround
nobody wants you around here and thats for sure
so get off our playground and stay away
thats all that weve got to say
suzyhangaround
yes youd better
look for a friend of your own suzyhangaround

i was at a party and this fella said to me
something bad is happening im sure you do agree
people care for nothing no respect for human rights
evil times are coming we are in for darker nights
i said who are you to talk about impending doom
he got kinda wary as he looked around the room
he said im a minister a big shot in the state
i said i just cant believe it boy i think its great
brother can you tell me what is right and what is wrong
he said keep on rocking baby til the night is gone
on and on and on
keep on rocking baby
til the night is gone
on and on and on
til the night is gone
on and on and on
keep on rocking baby
til the night is gone
on and on and on
til the night is gone
over in the corner i could see this other guy
he was kinda flirty he was giving me the eye
so i took advantage of the fact that im a star
shook my hair and took a casual stroll up to the bar
and as sure as hell this guy was coming up to me
he said who am i and who are you and who are we
whats our situation do we have some time for us
i said i was not exactly waiting for the bus
he said if youre going somewhere can i come along
i said keep on rocking baby til the night is gone
on and on and on
keep on rocking baby
til the night is gone
on and on and on
til the night is gone
on and on and on
keep on rocking baby
til the night is gone
on and on and on
til the night is gone
standing up is scary if you think youre gonna fall
like a humpty dumpty fraid of falling off the wall
i say if you ever want to know whats going on
gotta keep on rockin baby till the night is gone
where are those happy days they seem so hard to find
i tried to reach for you but you have closed your mind
whatever happened to our love
i wish i understood
it used to be so nice it used to be so good
so when youre near me darling cant you hear me
the love you gave me nothing else can save me
when youre gone
how can i even try to go on
when youre gone
though i try how can i carry on
you seem so far away though you are standing near
you made me feel alive but something died i fear
i really tried to make it out
i wish i understood
what happened to our love it used to be so good
so when youre near me darling cant you hear me
the love you gave me nothing else can save me
when youre gone
how can i even try to go on
when youre gone
though i try how can i carry on
so when youre near me darling cant you hear me
and the love you gave me nothing else can save me
when youre gone
how can i even try to go on
when youre gone
though i try how can i carry on
when youre gone
how can i even try to go on
when youre gone
though i try how can i carry on
no more champagne
and the fireworks are through
here we are me and you
feeling lost and feeling blue
its the end of the party
and the morning seems so grey
so unlike yesterday
nows the time for us to say
happy new year
happy new year
may we all have a vision now and then
of a world where every neighbour is a friend
happy new year
happy new year
may we all have our hopes our will to try
if we dont we might as well lay down and die
you and i
sometimes i see
how the brave new world arrives
and i see how it thrives
in the ashes of our lives
oh yes man is a fool
and he thinks hell be okay
dragging on feet of clay
never knowing hes astray
keeps on going anyway
happy new year
happy new year
may we all have a vision now and then
of a world where every neighbour is a friend
happy new year
happy new year
may we all have our hopes our will to try
if we dont we might as well lay down and die
you and i
seems to me now
that the dreams we had before
are all dead nothing more
than confetti on the floor
its the end of a decade
in another ten years time
who can say what well find
what lies waiting down the line
in the end of eightynine
happy new year
happy new year
may we all have a vision now and then
of a world where every neighbour is a friend
happy new year
happy new year
may we all have our hopes our will to try
if we dont we might as well lay down and die

the summer air was soft and warm
the feeling right
the paris night
did its best to please us
and strolling down the élysées
we had a drink in each café
you talked of politics philosophy
and i smiled like mona lisa
we had our chance
it was a fine and true romance
i can still recall our last summer
i still see it all
walks along the seine
laughing in the rain
our last summer
memories that remain
we made our way along the river
and we sat down in the grass
by the eiffel tower
i was so happy we had met
it was the age of no regret
those crazy years
that was the time of the flower power
but underneath we had a fear of flying
of getting old a fear of slowly dying
we took the chance
like we were dancing our last dance
i can still recall our last summer
i still see it all
in the tourist jam
round the notre dame
our last summer
walking hand in hand
paris restaurants
our last summer
morning croissants
living for the day
worries far away
our last summer
we could laugh and play
and now youre working in a bank
the family man the football fan
and your name is harry
how dull it seems
yet youre the hero of my dreams
i can still recall our last summer
i still see it all
walks along the seine
laughing in the rain
our last summer
memories that remain
i can still recall our last summer
i still see it all
in the tourist jam
round the notre dame
our last summer
walking hand in hand
paris restaurants
our last summer
morning croissants
we were living for the day
worries far away
our last summer

under attack im being taken
about to crack defences breaking
wont somebody please have a heart
come and rescue me now cos im falling apart
under attack im taking cover

can you hear the drums fernando
i remember long ago another starry night like this
in the firelight fernando
you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
i could hear the distant drums
and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
they were closer now fernando
every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
i was so afraid fernando
we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
and im not ashamed to say
the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty fernando
though we never thought that we could lose
theres no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando
if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando
now were old and grey fernando
since many years i havent seen a rifle in your hand
can you hear the drums fernando
do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the rio grande
i can see it in your eyes
how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty fernando
though we never thought that we could lose
theres no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando
there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty fernando
though we never thought that we could lose
theres no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando
yes if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando
if i had to do the same again
i would my friend fernando

i hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
the sound so ominously tearing through the silence
i cannot move im standing
numb and frozen
among the things i love so dearly
the books the paintings and the furniture
the signals sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
none of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
and they dont dare to come here
anymore now
but how i loved our secret meetings
we talked and talked in quiet voices
now i hear them moving
muffled noises coming through the door
i feel im 
crackin up
voices growing louder irritation building
and im close to fainting
crackin up
they must know by now im in here trembling
in a terror evergrowing
crackin up
my whole world is falling going crazy
there is no escaping now im
crackin up
these walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
and seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
and now theyve come to take me
come to break me
and yet it isnt unexpected
i have been waiting for these visitors
now i hear them moving
muffled noises coming through the door
i feel im 
crackin up
voices growing louder irritation building
and im close to fainting
crackin up
they must know by now im in here trembling
in a terror evergrowing
crackin up
my whole world is falling going crazy
there is no escaping now im
crackin up
now i hear them moving
muffled noises coming through the door
i feel im 
crackin up
voices growing louder irritation building
and im close to fainting
crackin up
they must know by now im in here trembling
in a terror evergrowing
crackin up
my whole world is falling going crazy
there is no escaping now im
crackin up
now i hear them moving
muffled noises coming through the door
i feel im 
crackin up
voices growing louder irritation building
and im close to fainting
crackin up
they must know by now im in here trembling
in a terror evergrowing
crackin up
my whole world is falling going crazy
there is no escaping now im
crackin up
you and i can share the silence
finding comfort together
the way old friends do
and after fights and words of violence
we make up with each other
the way old friends do
times of joy and times of sorrow
we will always see it through
oh i dont care what comes tomorrow
we can face it together
the way old friends do
you and i can share the silence
finding comfort together
the way old friends do
and after fights and words of violence
we make up with each other
the way old friends do
times of joy and times of sorrow
we will always see it through
oh i dont care what comes tomorrow
we can face it together
the way old friends do
we can face it together
the way old friends do
we can face it together
the way old friends do
we can face it together
the way old friends do
we can face it together
the way old friends do
i have a very good friend
the kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
she has a personal style
some people like it others tend to go wild
you hear her voice everywhere
taking the chair
shes a leading lady
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
head over heels
breaking her way
pushing through unknown jungles every day
shes a girl with a taste for the world
head over heels
setting the pace
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
shes extreme if you know what i mean
her man is one i admire
hes so courageous but hes constantly tired
each time when he speaks his mind
she pats his head and says òthats all very fine
exert that will of your own
when youre alone
now wed better hurryó
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
head over heels
breaking her way
pushing through unknown jungles every day
shes a girl with a taste for the world
head over heels
setting the pace
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
shes extreme if you know what i mean
you hear her voice everywhere
taking the chair
shes a leading lady
and with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
head over heels
breaking her way
pushing through unknown jungles every day
shes a girl with a taste for the world
head over heels
setting the pace
running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
shes extreme if you know what i mean
and she goes
head over heels
