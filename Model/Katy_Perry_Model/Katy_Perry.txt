greetings loved ones
lets take a journey
i know a place
where the grass is really greener
warm wet and wild
there must be something in the water
sippin gin and juice
laying underneath the palm trees 
the boys break their necks
tryna creep a little sneak peek 
you could travel the world
but nothing comes close
to the golden coast
once you party with us
youll be falling in love
california girls

daisy dukes
bikinis on top
sunkissed skin
well melt your popsicle
california girls

but nothing comes close
to the golden coast

youll be falling in love

i lost myself in fear of losing you
i wish i didnt do
but i did
i lost my own my own identity
forgot that you picked me for me
but now i dont negotiate with insecurities
they always seem to get the best of me
i found i had to love myself the way i wanted you to
no more second guessing
no there’s no more questioning
i’ll be the one defining who im gonna be
no concealing feelings or changing seasonally
i’m gonna love myself the way i want you to love me
sometimes i wish my skin was a costume
that i could just unzip
and strip
but who i am is who im meant to be
and its who you are in love in love with
so now i dont negotiate with insecurities
theyre gonna have to take a back seat
i know i have to love myself the way i want you to
no more second guessing
no there’s no more questioning
i’ll be the one defining who im gonna be
no concealing feelings or changing seasonally
i’m gonna love myself the way i want you to love me
no more standing in my own way
lets go deeper lets get closer
no more standing in my own way
no more second guessing
no there’s no more questioning
i’ll be the one defining who im gonna be
no concealing my feelings or changing seasonally
i’m gonna love myself the way i want you to love me
no more second guessing
no there’s no more questioning
i’ll be the one defining who im gonna be
no concealing feelings or changing seasonally
i’m gonna love myself the way i want you to love me
i hope you hang yourself with your hm scarf
while jacking off listening to mozart

secretly you’re so amused
that nobody understands you
i’m so mean cause i cannot get you outta your head
i’m so angry cause you’d rather myspace instead
i can’t believe i fell in love with someone that wears more makeup than…

i remember when you used to be my every other thought
but now my calendars so full its easier to move on
sometimes i swear i pass your suv on sunset blvd
i dont fuck with change but lately ive been flipping coins a lot
i struggle
i juggle
i could just throw a line to you
but i should let sleeping dogs lie cause i know better baby
i write it
erase it
repeat it
but what good will it do
to reopen the wound
so i take a deep breath
and i save as draft
you dont have to subtweet me
my numbers always been the same
but alls been said and done
will we ever really close this case
yeah i will always be here for you but i could no longer stay
still my body goes in shock every time i hear your name
i struggle
i juggle
i could just throw a line to you
but i should let sleeping dogs lie cause i know better baby
i write it
erase it
repeat it
but what good will it do
to reopen the wound
so i take a deep breath
and i save as draft
ive heard youve done some changing
ive been rearranging
wish that i could know but i just dont know
never get that time back
fear wed fall in old traps
why cant we just let go
staring at a fork in the fucking road
i struggle
i juggle
i could just throw a line to you
but i should let sleeping dogs lie cause i know better baby
i write it
erase it
repeat it
but what good will it do
to reopen the wound
so i take a deep breath
and i save as draft
this is the last time you say
after the last line you break
its not even a holiday
nothing to celebrate
you give a hundred reasons why
and say youre really gonna try
if i had a nickel for every time
id own the bank
thought that i was the exception
i could rewrite your addiction
you couldve been the greatest
but youd rather get wasted
you fall asleep during foreplay
cause the pills you take are more your forte
im not sticking around to watch you go down
wanna be your lover not your fuckin mother
cant be your savior i dont have the power
im not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain
you say you have to write your rhymes
whatever helps you sleep at night
youve become what you despise
a stereotype
you think youre so rock and roll
but youre really just a joke
had the world in the palm of your hands
but you fucking choked
shouldve been my team mate
couldve changed your fate
you say that you love me
you wont remember in the morning
you fall asleep during foreplay
cause the pills you take are more your forte
im not sticking around to watch you go down
wanna be your lover not your fucking mother
cant be your savior i dont have the power
im not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain
you fall asleep during foreplay
cause the pills you take are more your forte
im not sticking around to watch you go down
wanna be your lover not your fucking mother
cant be your savior i dont have the power
im not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain
watch you circle the drain
youre going down 
you fall asleep during foreplay
cause the pills you take are more your forte
im not sticking around to watch you go down
comparisons are easily done
once youve had a taste of perfection
like an apple hanging from a tree
i picked the ripest one
i still got the seed
you said move on
where do i go
i guess second best
is all i will know
cause when im with him
i am thinking of you
thinking of you
what you would do if
you were the one
who was spending the night
oh i wish that i
was looking into your eyes
youre like an indian summer
in the middle of winter
like a hard candy
with a surprise center
how do i get better
once ive had the best
you said theres
tons of fish in the water
so the waters i will test
he kissed my lips
i taste your mouth
he pulled me in
i was disgusted with myself
cause when im with him
i am thinking of you
thinking of you
what you would do if
you were the one
who was spending the night
oh i wish that i
was looking into
youre the best
and yes i do regret
how i could let myself
let you go
now now the lessons learned
i touched it i was burned
oh i think you should know
cause when im with him
i am thinking of you
thinking of you
what you would do if
you were the one
who was spending the night
oh i wish that i
was looking into your eyes
looking into your eyes
looking into your eyes
oh wont you walk through
and bust in the door
and take me away
oh no more mistakes
cause in your eyes id like to stay

im out on my own again
face down in the porcelain
feeling so high but looking so low
party favors on the floor
group of girls banging on the door
so many new fairweather friends ooo
have you ever been so lost
known the way and still so lost
caught in the eye of a hurricane
slowly waving goodbye like a pageant parade
so sick of this town pulling me down
my mother says i should come back home but
cant find the way cause the way is gone
so if i pray am i just sending words into outer space
have you ever been so lost
known the way and still so lost
another night waiting for someone to take me home
have you ever been so lost
is there a light
is there a light
at the end of the road
im pushing everyone away
cause i cant feel this anymore
cant feel this anymore
have you ever been so lost
known the way and still so lost
another night waiting for someone to take me home
have you ever been so lost
have you ever been so lost
you sent a text
its like the wind changed your mind
we were best friends
yeah we were building our life
with every kiss and every letter
every promise of forever oh
but you hit send
and disappeared in front of my eyes
and now you’re just a ghost
when i look back never would have known that
you could be so cold
like a stranger vanish like a vapor
theres just an echo where your heart used to be
now i see it clearly
and theres just a pillow where your head used to sleep
my visions 2020
i see through you now
something has died
now that i have made up my mind
ill be alright
it doesnt haunt me at night
cause every gift and every letter
every promise of forever
now its out of sight
like you were never alive
and now you’re just a ghost
when i look back never would have known that
you could be so cold
like a stranger vanish like a vapor
theres just an echo where your heart used to be
now i see it clearly
and theres just a pillow where your head used to sleep
my visions 2020
i see through you now
now now now now now
now now now now now
so rest in peace
ill see you on the other side
and now you’re just a ghost
when i look back never would have known that
you could be so cold
like a stranger vanish like a vapor
theres just an echo where your heart used to be
now i see it clearly
and theres just a pillow where your head used to sleep
my visions 2020
i see through you now
now now now now
i see through you now
now now now now
i see through you now
i can feel a phoenix inside of me
as i march alone to a different beat
slowly swallowing down my fear
i am ready for the road less traveled
suiting up for my crowning battle
this test is my own cross to bear
but i will get there
its never easy to be chosen never easy to be called
standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall
i can see the heavens but i still hear the flames
calling out my name
i can see the writing on the wall
i cant ignore this war
at the ehend of it all
who am i living for
i can feel this light thats inside of me
growing fast into a bolt of lightning
i know one spark will shock the world
so i pray for favour like esther
i need your strength to handle the pressure
i know there will be sacrifice
but thats the price
its never easy to be chosen never easy to be called
standing on the front line when the bombs start to fall
i can see the heavens but i still hear the flames
calling out my name
i can see the writing on the wall
i cant ignore this war
at the ehend of it all
who am i living for
i can see the writing on the wall
i cant ignore this war
at the ehend of it all
who am i living for
at the end at the end
who am i living for
at the end at the end
who am i living for
heavy is the head that wears the crown
dont let the greatness get you down
heavy is the head that wears the crown

usually the queen of figuring out
breaking down a man is no work out
but i have no clue how to get through to you
i wanna hit you just to see if you cry
i keep knocking on wood
hoping theres a real boy inside
cause youre not a man
youre just a mannequin
i wish you could feel
that my love is real
but youre not a man
i wish i could just turn you on
put a battery in and make you talk
even pull a string for you to say anything
but with you there is no guarantee
only expired warranty
a bunch of broken parts
and i cant seem to find your heart
im such a fool im such a fool im such a fool
this ones outta my hands
i cant put you back together again
cause youre not a man
youre just a mannequin
i wish you could feel
that my love is real
but youre not a man
youre just a toy
could you ever be a real real boy
and understand
but youre not a man
if the past is the problem
our future could solve them
i could bring you to life
if you let me inside
itll hurt but in the end
youll be a man
youre not a man
youre just a mannequin
i wish you could feel
that my love is real
could you ever be a real real boy
understand
but youre not a man
youre not a man
youre just a mannequin
i wish you could feel
that my love is real
but youre not a man
i can feel it happening happening
i can feel it happening happening
i can feel it
cant go with the flow got to make waves
even though i look at the sand and im just one grain
but my intuition says theres a bigger mission i must embrace
so im im pushing my thoughts to a new place
im kicking and screaming
cause it wont be easy
to break all the patterns
if im not evolving
im just another robot
taking up oxygen
its something bigger than me
i can feel it beginning
something bigger than me
that i can feel it opening
tried to ignore it
but it keeps on growing
out of control
its something bigger than me
and i can feel it happening
so ill speak my truth though my voice shakes
try to summon the strength to look fear in the face
but im kicking and screaming
cause it wont be easy
to break all the patterns
if im not evolving
im just another robot
taking up oxygen
its something bigger than me
i can feel it beginning
something bigger than me
that i can feel it opening
tried to ignore it
but it keeps on growing
out of control
its something bigger than me
and i can feel it happening
happening
i can feel it happening happening
i can feel it happening happening
i can feel it happening
i can feel it i can feel it
i can feel it happening
its something bigger than me
something bigger than me
that i can feel it opening
tried to ignore it
but it keeps on growing
out of control
its something bigger than me
and i can feel it happening
i can feel it 
happening
i can feel it 
happening
i can feel it 
happening
i built a wall so high no one could reach
a life of locks i swallowed all the keys
i was petrified only knew how to hide
they cant hurt me if they dont know me
a full façade made a mirage out of me
then you came and started diggin for a treasure underneath
and you found a better version of me i had never seen
into me you see
into me you see
you broke me wide open
open sesame
into me youll see
into me youll see
you got me wide open
now im ready
is this intimacy
i was a ship floating aimlessly
so camouflaged was my own worst enemy
but then you came in like a sailor with a heart that anchored me
and every day i wake up grateful im no longer lost at sea
into me you see
into me you see
you broke me wide open
open sesame
into me youll see
into me youll see
you got me wide open
now im ready
is this intimacy
oh cause no ones ever seen me like this
seen right through the bullshit
i pray that i can keep unfolding
pray that i can just stay open
just stay open
just stay open
just stay open
oh cause you broke me wide open
open sesame
into me youll see
into me youll see
you got me wide open
and now im ready
this is intimacy
remember when i dove into the crowd
and i got a bloody knee under my skin a mark from wiping out
it brings back the memories
every bones been broken
but my heart is still wide open
i cant stop
dont care if i lose
baby you are the weapon i choose
these wounds are self inflicted
im going down in flames for you
baby you are the weapon i choose
these wounds are self inflicted
one more thing im addicted too
with each scar theres a map that tells a story
what a souvenir of young loves like jumping out
an airplane riding a tidal wave on an ocean of emotion
my heart rips me wide open
and i cover up these scars
and i cant stop seeing stars
whenever youre around
i cant stop no i cant stop
no i cant stop
oh im going out in flames
oh im going down in flames
baby you are the weapon i choose
baby you are the weapon i choose
under a silver moon
tropical temperature
i feel my lotus bloom
come closer
i want your energy
i want your aura
you are my destiny
my mantra
i never knew i could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight 
oh oh oh oh oh
take me down to the river
underneath the bloodorange sun
say my name like a scripture
keep my heart beating like a drum
legendary lovers we could be legendary
la la la la la

do you ever feel like a plastic bag
drifting through the wind
wanting to start again
do you ever feel feel so paperthin
like a house of cards one blow from caving in
do you ever feel already buried deep
six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that theres still a chance for you
cause theres a spark in you
you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
just own the night like the 4th of july
cause baby youre a firework

baby youre a firework
come on let your colors burst
make em go ah ah ah
youre gonna leave em all in awe awe awe
you dont have to feel like a wasted space
youre original cannot be replaced
if you only knew what the future holds
after a hurricane comes a rainbow
maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
so you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
like a lightning bolt your heart will glow
and when its time youll know
you just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
just own the night like the 4th of july
cause baby youre a firework
come on show em what youre worth

was 27 surviving my return of saturn
a long vacation didnt sound so bad
was full of secrets locked up tight like iron mountain
running on empty so out of gas
thought i wasnt enough
found i wasnt so tough
laying on the bathroom floor
we were living on a fault line
and i felt the fault was all mine
couldnt take it anymore
by the grace of god
there was no other way
i picked myself back up
i knew i had to stay
i put one foot in front of the other
and i looked in the mirror
and decided to stay
wasnt gonna let love take me out that way
i thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
when the truth was like swallowing sand
now every morning there is no more mourning
oh i can finally see myself again
i know i am enough
possible to be loved
it was not about me
now i have to rise above
let the universe call the bluff
yeah the truth will set you free
by the grace of god
there was no other way
i picked myself back up
i knew i had to stay
i put one foot in front of the other
and i looked in the mirror
and decided to stay
wasnt gonna let love take me out that way
that way no
that way no
not in the name of love 
in the name of love
that way no
that way no
i am not giving up
by the grace of god
i picked myself back up
i put one foot in front of the other
and i looked in the mirror 
looked in the mirror
looked in the mirror 
looked in the mirror
by the grace of god
there was no other way
i picked myself back up
i knew i had to stay
i put one foot in front of the other
and i looked in the mirror
and decided to stay
wasnt gonna let love take me out that way

im losing all direction
slipping into quicksand
ive shattered the illusion
seen behind the curtain
im disenchanted
dancing on a wire
juggling desire
every hit gets harder
when youre fighting without armour
im disheartened
do i start over
rediscover
submit to the sweet surrender
its a mind maze
all these heart games
caught in a cage
a complex catch
am i a common folk
will i beat it all
im gonna feed myself and get out of my own way
used to be so sparkling
but now its not so charming
what used to stimulate me
now can barely wake me
im unresponsive
will i find salvation
some kind of moderation
spinning all these plates is
gonna be a challenge
a delicate balance
so do i start over
rediscover
submit to the sweet surrender
its a mind maze
all these heart games
caught in a cage
a complex catch
am i a common folk
will i beat it all
im gonna feed myself and get out of my own way
get out of my own way
get out of my own way
get out of my own way
so i start over
rerediscover
i submit to your your sweet surrender
your sweet surrender
your sweet surrender
you make me feel like im losing my virginity
the first time every time when youre touching me
i make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
under the sun we are one buzzing energy
lets pollinate to create a family tree
this evolution with you comes naturally
some call it science we call it chemistry
this is the story of the birds and the bees
and even when seasons change
our love still stays the same
you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
spread my wings and make me fly
the taste of your honey is so sweet
when you give me the hummingbird heartbeat hummingbird heartbeat
hummingbird heartbeat
hummingbird heartbeat
ive flown a million miles just to find a magic seed
a white flower with the power to bring life to me
youre so exotic get my whole body fluttering
constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
always on the brink of a heart attack
you keep me alive and keep me coming back

she is a pyramid
but with him shes just a grain of sand
this loves too strong like mice and men
squeezing out the life that should be let in
she was a hurricane 
cane cane cane
but now shes just a gust of wind
she used to set the sails of a thousand ships
was a force to be reckoned with
she could be a statue of liberty
she could be a joan of arc
but hes scared of the light thats inside of her
so he keeps her in the dark
oh she used to be a pearl
yeah she used to rule the world
cant believe shes become a shell of herself
cause she used to be a pearl
she was unstoppable
moved fast just like an avalanche
but now shes stuck deep in cement
wishing that theyd never ever met
she could be a statue of liberty
she could be a joan of arc
but hes scared of the light thats inside of her
so he keeps her in the dark
oh she used to be a pearl
yeah she used to rule the world
cant believe shes become a shell of herself

but i woke up and grew strong
and i can still go on
and no one can take my pearl
you dont have to be a shell no
youre the one that rules your world oh
you are strong
and youll learn that you can still go on
and youll always be a—a pearl
she is unstoppable
i used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
scared to rock the boat and make a mess
so i sit quietly
agree politely
i guess that i forgot i had a choice
i let you push me past the breaking point
i stood for nothing
so i fell for everything
you held me down but i got up 
already brushing off the dust
you hear my voice you hear that sound
like thunder gonna shake the ground
you held me down but i got up 
get ready cause ive had enough
i see it all i see it now

get ready cause ive had enough
