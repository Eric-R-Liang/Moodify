little lady this is just the worst way to spend your birthday
its 30 degrees thursday
you work late you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his mercedes
lady the word rape sums up events that take place every night
you wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
and you remember that your punter went crazy last night
you drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
youll make a trip to the whittington where theyll look at your jaw
theyll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
theyll know youre fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
but young woman
the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
medical attention could be fatal
cause the cunt wouldnt ever let a doctor near someone thats getting dough for him
cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in
shes just under the upper hand
and goes mad for a couple grams
and she dont wanna go outside tonight
cause in the pipe shell fly to the motherland and
sell love to another man
its too cold outside for angels to fly
for angels to fly
little lady your mind youve made up
your injuries you cant hide with makeup
you need some medical advice you make up
a little lie to say just
in case the doc opens his eyes and dont decide to play dumb
with any luck youll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
last year when your pimp just lost it
he wouldnt recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
cause all the heroin is making you age
but youre a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
the funds you have left go where youre from using moneygram
mother had to get you out the motherland to study
that was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
little does she know youre never coming back
she put you in her brothers hand only for him to formulate another plan
hes the fucking cause of your appalling state this summer
fancy that you came to london to get pimped by your uncle damn
shes just under the upper hand
goes mad for a couple grams
and she dont wanna go outside tonight
cause in the pipe shell fly to the motherland and
sell love to another man
its too cold outside for angels to fly
now an angel will die covered in white
with closed eyes and hoping for a better life
this time well fade out tonight
straight down the line
little lady youre trembling with fear
your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
youre sitting facing the detective oh dear
the meddling nurse couldnt just leave it
shes only gone and made it much worse calling police in
shell never know the gravity of the damage shes caused
youre causing scandal going mad in the ward now
the cop is trying to calm you telling you he wont let no one harm you
the same question he keeps trying to ask you who you working for
hes talking to you like youre worth more than a dirty whore
youre having a conversation you could be murdered for
youre learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
its kicking knowledge you aint ever heard before
just before he leaves he reassures you that he knows that its hard
he underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
begs you to use it
hes useless if youre gonna be stupid
cause an answer hasnt come from your bruised lips youre on your own
youve gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
you reach your door and then it dawns that youve been followed home
before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
and then a voice says where you been bitch i wanna know
no prizes for guessing who it is resistance would be foolishness
you open the front door he boots you in
theres something new in him hes silent now that fills you with terror
get your alibi straight you could be killed for an error
he towers over you the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight
at this point your life flashes before your eyes
your handbags dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
despite the mess theres only one thing thats caught his eye
and in the moment of rage he brutally murders his niece
and dumps her body in the boot of his merc in the street
little lady left this earth in the worst way
all because she got a card on her 13th birthday
and were all under the upper hand
and go mad for a couple grams
and we dont wanna go outside tonight
cause in the pipe shell fly to the motherland and
sell love to another man
its too cold outside for angels to fly for angels to fly and fly fly
for angels to fly to fly to fly angels to die
i paid all my dues
and she wanted to know
that id never leave her
now im ready to go
and strange as it seems
shes endless to me
shes just like paperwork
but harder to read
patience my enemy
and lovings my friend
its harder to leave
with my heart on my sleeve
than to stay and just pretend
oh she knows me so well
oh she knows me like i know myself
i made all my plans
and she has made hers
she kept me in mind
but i wasnt sure
i searched every room
for a way to escape
but every time
i tried to leave
she keeps holding on to me
for dear life
and blocking my way
patience my enemy
and lovings my friend
its harder to leave
with my heart on my sleeve
than to stay and just pretend
oh she knows me so well
oh she knows me like i know myself
and like the back of her hand
she already understands everything
wont you stay
she says
and she already knows how it goes
and where she stands
ill stay anyway
cos she knows me so well
oh she knows me like i know myself
oh she knows me so well
oh she knows me like i know myself
i know myself
oh she knows me like i know myself
i know myself
i know myself
i know myself

youre just a small bump unborn
in four months youre brought to life
you might be left with my hair
but youll have your mothers eyes
ill hold your body in my hands
be as gentle as i can
but for now youre a scan of my unmade plans
a small bump
in four months youre brought to life
ill whisper quietly
ill give you nothing but truth
if youre not inside me
ill put my future in you
you are my one and only
you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
oh you are my one and only
you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
and youll be alright
oh youre just a small bump unknown
youll grow into your skin
with a smile like hers
and a dimple beneath your chin
fingernails the size
of a half grain of rice
and eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
a small bump
in four months youll open your eyes
and ill hold you tightly
ill tell you nothing but truth
if youre not inside me
ill put my future in you
you are my one and only
you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
oh you are my one and only
you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
and youll be alright
and you can lie with me
with your tiny feet
when youre half asleep
ill leave you be
right in front of me
for a couple weeks
so i can keep you safe
cause you are my one and only
you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
you are my one and only
you can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight
and youll be alright
cause you were just a small bump unborn
for four months then torn from life
maybe you were needed up there
but were still unaware as why
they tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
but now im working to achieve but sleep is the only thing i never see
and i vowed that my breathing will never cease
to the retrieve then i cant let them be
i wont let em leave and i had the same feeling since 17
but i wasnt ready then like a lemons green
now im in the magazines almost every week
cause im getting heat like in tenerife
right now its better than its ever been
never fade like a plant thats evergreen
its what i hoped in my heart but my self doubts are getting me
faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and im getting weak
cause im new im not where the stars be
they chase dreams together like a slumber party
and now im on my own even though im smooth sailing
im scared to sing cause my nightmaresll fade in
when the darkness creeps in
i feel my nightmares watching me
and when my dreams are sleeping
i feel my nightmares watching me

now im taking control of my inception
cause they try to hit my misses with my erection

not even argentinas gonna cry for them
see im awake at night with the ammunish
the haters know where the family lives

and daydream about losing my sanity
ive been rhyming forever got a blind flow

white lips pale face
breathing in snowflakes
burnt lungs sour taste
lights gone days end
struggling to pay rent
long nights strange men
and they say
shes in the class a team
stuck in her daydream

but lately her face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries
and they scream
the worst things in life come free to us
cause were just under the upper hand
and go mad for a couple grams
and she dont want to go outside tonight
and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
or sells love to another man
its too cold outside
for angels to fly
angels to fly
ripped gloves raincoat
tried to swim and stay afloat
dry house wet clothes
loose change bank notes
wearyeyed dry throat
call girl no phone
and they say
shes in the class a team
stuck in her daydream
been this way since eighteen
but lately her face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries
and they scream
the worst things in life come free to us
cause were just under the upper hand
and go mad for a couple grams
and she dont want to go outside tonight
and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
or sells love to another man
its too cold outside
for angels to fly
an angel will die
covered in white
closed eye
and hoping for a better life
this time well fade out tonight
straight down the line
and they say
shes in the class a team
stuck in her daydream

but lately her face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries
they scream
the worst things in life come free to us
and were all under the upper hand

and we dont want to go outside tonight
and in a pipe we fly to the motherland
or sell love to another man

this love is a blaze
i saw flames from the side of the stage
and the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
but something to drink and maybe something to smoke
let it go until our roads are changed
singing we found love in a local rave
no i dont really know what im supposed to say
but i can just figure it out and hope and pray
i told her my name and said its nice to meet ya
then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
i already know shes a keeper
just from this one small act of kindness
im in deep shit if anybody finds out
im meant to drive home but ive drunk all of it now not
sobering up we just sit on the couch
one thing led to another
now shes kissing my mouth

you look so wonderful in your dress
i love your hair like that
the way it falls on the side of your neck
down your shoulders and back
we are surrounded by all of these lies
and people who talk too much
you got the kind of look in your eyes
as if no one knows anything but us
should this be the last thing i see
i want you to know its enough for me
cause all that you are is all that ill ever need
im so in love so in love
so in love so in love
you look so beautiful in this light
your silhouette over me
the way it brings out the blue in your eyes
is the tenerife sea
and all of the voices surrounding us here
they just fade out when you take a breath
just say the word and i will disappear
into the wilderness
should this be the last thing i see
i want you to know its enough for me
cause all that you are is all that ill ever need
im so in love so in love
so in love so in love
lumière darling
lumière over me

and make me laugh as if im in on the joke

to help you fall asleep tonight

i was born inside a small town i lost that state of mind
learned to sing inside the lords house
but stopped at the age of nine
i forget when i get awards now the wave i had to ride
the paving stones i played upon that kept me on the grind
so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
and when the worlds against me is when i really come alive
and every day that satan tempts me i try to take it in my stride
you know that ive got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
i think life has got to the point i know without its no fun
i need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
instead i look in the mirror questioning what ive become
guess its a stereotypical day for someone like me
without a nine to five job or a uni degree
to be caught up in the trappings of the industry
show me the locked doors ill find another use for the key and youll see
im well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
but with that said give me one more
i am another one to take the sting away
i am happy on my own so here ill stay
save your loving arms for a rainy day
and ill find comfort in my pain eraser
i used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
i chased the picture perfect life i think they painted it wrong
i think that money is the route of all evil and fame is hell
relationships and hearts you fix they break as well
and aint nobody want to see you down in the dumps
because youre living your dream and this should be fun
please know that im not trying to preach like im reverend run
i beg you dont be disappointed with the man ive become
conversations with my father on the a14
age 12 telling me ive gotta chase those dreams
now im playing for the people dad and they know me
with my beaten small guitar wearing the same old jeans
wembley stadium crowds two hundred and forty thou
i may have grown up but i hope that damians proud
and to the next generation inspirations allowed
the world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now somehow
im well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
but with that said give me one more
i am another one to take the sting away
oh i am happy on my own so here ill stay
well save your loving arms for a rainy day
and ill find comfort in my pain eraser
and ill find comfort in my pain eraser
and ill find comfort in my pain eraser
welcome to the new show
i guess you know ive been away
where im heading who knows
my heart will stay the same
welcome to the new show
i guess you know ive been away
where im heading who knows
my pain eraser
and ill find comfort in my pain eraser
and ill find comfort in my pain eraser
and ill find comfort in my pain eraser
and ill find comfort in my pain eraser
i found a love for me
darling just dive right in and follow my lead
well i found a girl beautiful and sweet
oh i never knew you were the someone waiting for me
cause we were just kids when we fell in love
not knowing what it was
i will not give you up this time
but darling just kiss me slow
your heart is all i own
and in your eyes youre holding mine
baby im dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass
listening to our favourite song
when you said you looked a mess
i whispered underneath my breath
but you heard it
darling you look perfect tonight
well i found a woman stronger than anyone i know
she shares my dreams i hope that someday ill share her home
i found a love to carry more than just my secrets
to carry love to carry children of our own
we are still kids but were so in love
fighting against all odds
i know well be alright this time
darling just hold my hand
be my girl ill be your man
i see my future in your eyes
baby im dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass
listening to our favourite song
when i saw you in that dress
looking so beautiful
i dont deserve this
darling you look perfect tonight
no no no
baby im dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass
listening to our favourite song
i have faith in what i see
now i know i have met an angel in person
and she looks perfect
i dont deserve this
you look perfect tonight
walking down 29th and park
i saw you in anothers arms
only a month weve been apart
you look happier
saw you walk inside a bar
he said something to make you laugh
i saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
yeah you look happier you do
aint nobody hurt you like i hurt you
but aint nobody love you like i do
promise that i will not take it personal baby
if youre moving on with someone new
cause baby you look happier you do
my friends told me one day ill feel it too
and until then ill smile to hide the truth
but i know i was happier with you
sat in the corner of the room
everythings reminding me of you
nursing an empty bottle and telling myself youre happier
arent you
aint nobody hurt you like i hurt you
but aint nobody need you like i do
i know that theres others that deserve you
but my darling i am still in love with you
but i guess you look happier you do
my friends told me one day ill feel it too
i could try to smile to hide the truth
but i know i was happier with you
baby you look happier you do
i knew one day youd fall for someone new
but if he breaks your heart like lovers do
just know that ill be waiting here for you
you’re not her
though i try to see you differently
i tow the line
you see i’m searching for what used to be mine
i saw your eyes
and then i saw her staring back at me
and i will try to find another one
who suited me as well as her
ive moved far away from you
and i want to see you here beside me dear
but things aren’t clear
when we never even tried
we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful
whenever i was away
i’d miss you
i miss you
she was mine
i was hers
and all that’s in between
if she would cry
i would shelter her
and keep her from the darkness that will be
if i moved far away from you
and i want to see you here beside me dear
but things aren’t clear
we never even tried
we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful
whenever i was away
i’d miss you
and i miss you
don’t drop me in
it’s not my turn
if you cut deep
then i might learn
if you scar and leave me
like a sunburn
don’t drop me in
it’s not my turn
if you cut deep
then i might learn
you scarred and left me
like a sunburn
we never even tried
we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful
whenever i was away
i’d miss you
i miss you
when your legs dont work like they used to before
and i cant sweep you off of your feet
will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
and darling i will be loving you til were 70
and baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
and im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe just the touch of a hand
well me—i fall in love with you every single day
and i just wanna tell you i am
so honey now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart
im thinking out loud
maybe we found love right where we are
when my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
and the crowds dont remember my name
when my hands dont play the strings the same way 
i know you will still love me the same
cause honey your soul could never grow old its evergreen
and baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe its all part of a plan
well ill just keep on making the same mistakes
hoping that youll understand
that baby now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
place your head on my beating heart
thinking out loud
maybe we found love right where we are 
la la la la la la la la loud
so baby now
take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
oh darling place your head on my beating heart
im thinking out loud
but maybe we found love right where we are
oh baby we found love right where we are
and we found love right where we are
ah lahmlahlah
ah lahmlahlah
i met this girl late last year
she said dont you worry if i disappear
i told her im not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jump right in
a week later returned
i reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around 10
baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
well be in between the sheets til the late am
baby if you wanted me then you shouldve just said
shes singing
ah lahmlahlah
dont fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
ah lahmlahlah
dont fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i dont wanna know that babe
ah lahmlahlah
and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her
we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before a text message was the only way to reach her
now shes staying at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha
all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep i guess that i dont want to either
but me and her we make money the same way
four cities two planes the same day
and those shows have never been what its about
but maybe well go together and just figure it out
id rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane
or well be missing it now
wish id have written it down
the way that things played out
when she was kissing him
how i was confused about
now she should figure it out while im sat here singing
ah lahmlahlah
dont fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
ah lahmlahlah
dont fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i dont wanna know that babe
ah lahmlahlah
i dont even know if she knows what for
she was crying on my shoulder
i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next
but you didnt need to take him to bed thats all
and i never saw him as a threat
until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
its not like we were both on tour
we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
and i wasnt looking for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realize what you wanted
its a bit too much too late if im honest
and all this time god knows im singing
ah lahmlahlah
dont fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
ah lahmlahlah
dont fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i dont wanna know that babe
ah lahmlahlah

its just another night
and im staring at the moon
i saw a shooting star
and thought of you
i sang a lullaby
by the waterside and knew
if you were here
id sing to you
youre on the other side
as the skyline splits in two
miles away from seeing you
but i can see the stars from america
i wonder do you see them too
so open your eyes and see
the way our horizons meet
and all of the lights will lead
into the night with me
and i know these scars will bleed
but both of our hearts believe
all of these stars will guide us home
i can hear your heart
on the radio beat
theyre playing chasing cars
and i thought of us
back to the time
you were lying next to me
i looked across and fell in love
so i took your hand
back through lamplit streets and knew
everything led back to you
so can you see the stars over amsterdam
hear the song my heart is beating to
so open your eyes and see
the way our horizons meet
and all of the lights will lead
into the night with me
and i know these scars will bleed
but both of our hearts believe
all of these stars will guide us home
and oh i know
and oh i know oh
and i know oh oh oh
i can see the stars from america

acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat

when i was six years old i broke my leg
i was running from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down
i was younger then
take me back to when
i found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and ive not seen the roaring fields in so long
i know ive grown
but i cant wait to go home
im on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way
you make me feel
and its real
when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
fifteen years old and smoking handrolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night
i dont reckon that i did it right
i was younger then
take me back to when
we found weekend jobs when we got paid
wed buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
oh how weve grown
but i cant wait to go home
im on my way
driving at 90 down those country lanes
singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way
you make me feel
and its real
when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone
ones brother overdosed
ones already on his second wife
ones just barely getting by
but these people raised me
and i cant wait to go home
and im on my way
i still remember these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way
you make me feel
and its real
when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
you give me life
like lots of oxygen
you treat me like
i was in love again
and i hold you tight
tight enough to know
that you are mine
id never let you go
and its you i miss
and its you i miss
so let it out
and let it out now
and let it out
and let it out now now

when were resembling cutlery
on the sofa
it must have been
like my blue ripped jeans
and my eyes are closed
and im way too tired
hoody still smells of the beach bonfire
on the sofa where we lay
i wanna stay inside all day
and its cold outside again
and were both so high
we could fly to berlin tokyo or jamaica
we can go where you want
say the word and ill take ya
but id rather stay on the sofa
on the sofa with you
when the morning comes
were not watching formula one
its not what we breathe for
so kick off the day with friends on t4
two boiled and brew
two sugars aint too sweet for you
on the sofa where we lay
i wanna stay inside all day
and its cold outside again
and were still so high
we could fly to berlin tokyo or jamaica
we can go where you want
say the word and ill take ya
but id rather stay on the sofa
on the sofa with you
and it feels like im flying
and it feels like
we could go to berlin tokyo or jamaica
through the streets of new york
that is where i will take ya
paris rome to rio
passing through las vegas
we can go where you want
say the word and ill take ya
but id rather stay on the sofa
on the sofa
on the sofa with you
i took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
i threw the dayold tea from the cup
packed up the photo album matthew had made
memories of a life thats been loved
took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
poured the old ginger beer down the sink
dad always told me dont you cry when youre down
but mom theres a tear every time that i blink
oh im in pieces
its tearing me up but i know
a heart thats broke is a heart thats been loved
so ill sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
when i fell down youd be there holding me up
spread your wings as you go
and when god takes you back
hell say hallelujah youre home
i fluffed the pillows made the beds stacked the chairs up
folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
john said hed drive then put his hand on my cheek
and wiped a tear from the side of my face
and i hope that i see the world as you did cause i know
a life with love is a life thats been lived
so ill sing hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
when i fell down youd be there holding me up
spread your wings as you go 
when god takes you back
hell say hallelujah youre home
hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
you got to see the person i have become
spread your wings and i know
that when god took you back he said hallelujah youre home
i found your hair band on my bedroom floor
the only evidence that youd been here before
and i dont get waves of missing you anymore
theyre more like tsunami tides
in my eyes
never getting dry
so i get high
smoke away the days never sleep with the light on
weeks pass in the blink of an eye
and im still drunk at the end of the night
i dont drink like everybody else
i do it to forget things about myself
stumble and fall
with the head spin i got
my minds with you but my hearts just not
so am i close to you anymore if its over
and theres no chance that well work it out
thats why you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied
everybody said wed be together forever
but i know that i never wanna settle down
come around break up the love like lego now
never wanna turn into another like you
sleep with my thoughts
and i dance with my views
everythings great not everythings sure
but you live in your halls and i live in a tour bus
now im in a position to be another stalker
like everything i say seems to all sound awkward
like our last kiss
it was perfect
but we were nervous on the surface
and im always saying everyday that it was worth it
pain is only relevant if it still hurts
i forget like an elephant
or we can use a sedative
and go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss
so am i close to you anymore if its over
and theres no chance that well work it out
you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied
woooooahhhh 
2x oohh ohh
because if i was gonna go somewhere
id be there by now
and maybe i can let myself down
and im thinking that im unaware
i keep my feet on the ground
and keep looking around
to make sure im not the only one to feel low
because if you want
ill take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
from all that ive done wrong
and i know youll say
that im the only one
but i know god made another one of me to love you better than i ever will
cause you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied
you and i ended over u n i
and i said thats fine but youre the only one that knows i lied
i seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
admiring the scene inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
jetlagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
although my eyes are heavy they wont be closing soon
cause i heard that time waits for nobody i suppose its true
we make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
to see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves
i say whatever i feel to vent a rhyme
so i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
cause real will recognise real is what my father says
and ill be sticking to this phrase until i pass away
overworking no sleep is just another way to die slow
but ill just keep going strong and never let my eyes close
5 oclock with lights off
interview with a vampire
sleep is for the living and not a utensil that i require
i swear i said that ill sleep when im dead
whos on the beat upon the feature with ed its dev to the z
overtired palefaced like michael myers
bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage ive acquired
and over the time within this maze ill think youll find youll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
cause i got too much to stay awake for to sleep or even take 4 seconds out the game
its time to wage war
scissors grab a sword and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
im haling from the essex and the east london boarder line
villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes
be wide awake just like your snorting lines
or get left mortified like youve just seen the ghost of jesus walking by
i never sleep
when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be
the times im living in i never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be
the times im living in lately
i brush my teeth every night but still i wake up with a bad mouth
and the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
deliver the raps how i flow
i live with the raps now and those that hate me call me ron
but they wont slytherin too easy believe me im snape minded
be within this great time be on minimum wage life is a prison escape that im in
its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
i try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows
some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with silocon
im still broke without the money for a mac pro living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow
opposite of sober cause i never did my homework
which has got me on the sofa no degree but growing older
i played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie
await death take deep breaths try to never die
never die
2 guys with the same view keep it tight like screws
making metaphors flow and move like typhoons and tunes
and if we got our eyes on you well catch you while you snooze
times elapsing while your catching zs the masses like to move
we scan the situation analyse information and then decide what probably is most practical to do
driven young gentlemen
ive hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months causei havent slept in them true
im coming home the lights are on your rights are wrong so im correcting em
we got the fans all like oh wow its devs and ed what less did you bloody expect from em
in the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
fighting through writers block from 9 oclock to 5 oclock and no way will i ever waste a second of the time i got
i keep my pupils engaged
like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake
i never sleep
when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be
the times im living in i never sleep when trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free it could be
the times im living in lately
she is the sweetest thing that i know
you should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
shakes my soul like a pot hole every time
took my heart upon a one way trip
guess she went wandering off with it
unlike most women i know
this one will bring it back whole
daisies daisies perched upon your forehead
oh my baby lately i know
that every night ill kiss you youll say in my ear
oh were in love arent we
hands in your hair fingers and thumbs baby
i feel safe when youre holding me near
love the way that you conquer your fear
you know hearts dont break around here
oh yeah yeah yeah  yeah yeah yeah yeah
she is the river flow in orwell
and tin wind chimes used for doorbells
fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
spent my summer time beside her
and the rest of the year the same
she is the flint that sparks the lighter
and the fuel that will hold the flame
oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread
oh my hold this oh this i know
that every night ill kiss you youll say in my ear
oh were in love arent we
hands in your hair fingers and thumbs baby
i feel safe when youre holding me near
love the way that you conquer your fear

oh yeah yeah yeah
well i found love in the inside
the arms of a woman i know
she is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home
and im not scared of passing over
or the thought of growing old
because from now until i go
every night ill kiss you youll say in my ear
oh were in love arent we
hands in your hair fingers and thumbs baby
i feel safe when youre holding me near
love the way that you conquer your fear
you know hearts dont break around here
oh yeah yeah
every night ill kiss you youll say in my ear
oh were in love arent we
hands in your hair fingers and thumbs baby
i feel safe when youre holding me near
love the way that you conquer your fear
you know hearts dont break around here
yeah yeah yeah
you know hearts dont break around here
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
oh im a mess right now
inside out
searching for a sweet surrender
but this is not the end
i cant work it out
how going through the motions
going through us
and oh ive known it for the longest time
and all of my hopes
all of my own words
are all over written on the signs
but youre on my road
walking me home
see the flames inside my eyes
it burns so bright i wanna feel your love
easy baby maybe im a liar
but for tonight i wanna fall in love
put your faith in my stomach
i messed up this time
late last night
drinking to suppress devotion
with fingers intertwined
i cant shake this feeling now

hoping youd stop
and ohhh ive only caused you pain
i know but all of my words will always below
of all the love you spoke
when youre on my road

these thoughts i have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid
the goals i reach are not near ones the further than limits
i block her out so when im looking through my mind she aint in it
can i be free for a minute can i be me for a minute
the thoughts i have can be dark ones even be smart ones
know im gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
tell you what i think i will until i depart mum
its you that i lived for i am the first and the last one to love you lots
whats better than thinking about the ones you love
nothing much when youre thinking about the ones you love
i feel the same when im in the floor see the sun above
unconditional like bills paid when i run them up
no one here to help you pain now youre gonna moan
no one here to save the day now youre all alone
wish i was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
fact is i wasnt so im coming from a colder zone
and when the sun falls down ill be up again
i never close my eyes
and if the dawn might break ill see nothing when 
nothing when
my thoughts are only you and my mind is over you
my thoughts are over you and these words are all for you 
all for you
i wanna see you happy i wanna see you smile
cause youre been trespassing and you wont leave my mind

burning fires in this room
it just fits
light and smooth
like my feet in my shoes
little one lie with me
sew your heart to my sleeve
well stay quiet
underneath shooting stars
if it helps you sleep
and hold me tight
dont let me breathe
feeling like
you wont believe
theres a firefly
loose tonight
better catch it
before it burns this place down
and i lie
if i dont feel so right
but the world looks better
through your eyes
teach my skin
those new tricks
warm me up
with your lips
heart to heart
melt me down
its too cold
in this town
close your eyes
lean on me
face to mouth
lips to cheek
feeling numb
in my feet

to help me get to sleep
and hold me tight
dont let me breathe
feeling like
you wont believe
theres a firefly
loose tonight

before it burns this place down
and i lie

one night of love
and maybe
that is not enough

one night of love
and maybe

your body is my ballpoint pen
and your mind is my new best friend
your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again
now i see it in your movements tonight
if we should ever do this right

youre strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but ive never felt this way
ill pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down
things were all good yesterday
and then the devil took your memory
and if you fell to your death today
i hope that heaven is your resting place
i heard the doctors put your chest in pain
but then that could have been the medicine
and now youre lying in the bed again
either way ill cry with the rest of them

although my grandma used to say
he used to sing
darlin hold me in your arms
the way you did last night
and well lie inside
for a little while here oh

and slowly let them shut
for theyre designed to be together oh
with your body next to mine
our hearts will beat as one
and we set alight

black suit black tie standing in the rain

if we take this bird in
with its broken leg
we could nurse it
she said
come inside
for a little lie down with me
if you fall asleep
it wouldn’t be the worst thing
but when i wake up
your makeup is on my shoulder
and tell me if i lie down
would you stay now
and let me hold you
but if i kissed you
will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you
strawberries taste how lips do
and it’s not complete yet
mustn’t get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret
diving in too soon
and i’ll owe it all to you
my little bird
my little bird
if we take a walk out
in the morning dew
we could lay down
so i’m next to you
come inside
for a little homemade tea
if you fall asleep
then at least you’re next to me
and if i wake up
you see it’s late love
go back to sleep
i’m covered by nature
and i’m safe now
underneath this oak tree
with you beside me
but if i kissed you
will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you
strawberries taste how lips do
and it’s not complete yet
mustn’t get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret
diving in too soon
and i’ll owe it all to you
my little bird
my little bird
my little bird
my little bird
and of all these things
i’m sure of
i’m not quite certain
of your love
and you made me scream
but then i made you cry
when i left that little bird
with its broken leg to die
but if i kissed you
will your mouth read this truth
darling how i miss you
strawberries taste how lips do
and it’s not complete yet
mustn’t get our feet wet
cause that leads to regret
diving in too soon
but i’ll owe it all to you
my little bird
my little bird whoa oh oh
my little bird
my little bird
you’re my little bird
lying in a bedroom
lighting up a benson
face hair is growing
so i cut it with a vengeance
hey did i mention
as she makes an entrance
said i had a tendency
to finish off a sentence
oh well she’s a local girl
no makeup
cause she knows me well
hair tied up in elastic band
with a kiss on the cheek
for her onenight man
is it fast food
i’ll regret it after
and i needed money
but i’m too shy to ask her
so she buys me chips and cheese
and i tell her that i love her
and she’s all i need
i take it with a cold glass
of the fruit and the barley
she’s still a sucker for the
apple and bacardi
heading to the party
sitting in the car seat
on radio
it makes me feel naughty and lastly
she knows me well
bit of a catch
to have a local girl
hair tied up in elastic band
with a kiss on the cheek
for her onenight man
i don’t wanna go alone
i don’t wanna go alone
no i dont wanna go alone
tell her that i love her
tell her that i need her
tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand
tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
all i wanna do is be near
tell her that i want her
tell her that i need her
tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand
tell her that i love her more than anyone else
if you don’t i’ll tell her myself
and we’ve got that love in us
so if the drink kill us
we’re gonna dance all night
till the floor fillers
if we talk outside
say i hate wasps too
i don’t really dance
so i’ll just watch you
are you taking me back tonight
tell me if that’s alright
i don’t wanna be here
i’m not the sofa type
tell me if you have a toothbrush
you don’t mind sharing
she said i wanna take off
what you’re wearing
and i don’t wanna go alone
i don’t wanna go alone
i don’t wanna go alone oh
tell her that i love her
tell her that i need her
tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand
tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
all i wanna do is be near
tell her that i want her
tell her that i need her
tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand
tell her that i love her more than anyone else
if you don’t i’ll tell her myself
she’s like the fast food
i’ll regret it after
and i needed money
but i’m too shy to ask her
but she buys me chips and cheese
so i tell her that she’s all i need
tell her that i
tell her that i
tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand
tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
all i wanna do is be near
tell her that i
tell her that i
tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand
tell her that i love her more than anyone else
if you don’t i’ll tell her myself
now tell her that i love her
tell her that i need her
that she’s more than a onenight stand
tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
all i wanna do is be near
tell her that i want her
tell her that i need her
tell her that she’s more than a onenight stand
tell her that i love her more than anyone else
if you don’t i’ll tell her myself
this city never sleeps
i hear the people walk by when its late
sirens bleed through my windowsill
i cant close my eyes
dont control what im into
this tower is alive
the lights that blind keep me awake
my hood up and lace untied
sleep fills my mind
dont control what im into
london calls me a stranger
a traveler
this is now my home my home
im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in the backseat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
and if the city never sleeps
then that makes two
the pavement is my friend
hey and it will take me where i need to go
i find it trips me up
and puts me down
this is not what im used to
the shop across the road
fulfills my needs and gives me company
when i need it
voices speak through my walls
i dont think im gonna make it
past tomorrow
london calls me a stranger
a traveler
this is now my home my home
im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in the backseat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
and if the city never sleeps
then that makes two
and my lungs hurt
and my ears bled
with the sound of the city life
echoed in my head
do i need this to keep me alive
the traffic stops and starts
but i need to move along
im from a city where the rain wont sleep
pollution in the air matches that on the street
the black smoke
gets your head into a muddle like
walking into elephants
syringes in a puddle like
i was a country boy when i moved out
grew up too fast for my family to find out
now i try to stop my music running into nose dives
cant resort to arrogance
with white lies
this city wants to raise me
but i cant help but see just
how this dark city changed me
its all the same see
music is my life but
now i try to fight
whatever i need to hide from
north south east west
londons my home now
knees weak but we never slow down
now i start to do my music properly
ill stay away from all the negative shit
that will follow me
london calls me a stranger
this is not my home home
im burning on the back street
stuck here sitting in the backseat
im blazing on the street
what i do isnt up to you
and if the city never sleeps
then that makes two
i’m in so deep omar epps can relate to my situation on a real 
pain ain’t the emotion i wanna feel but i’m thriving off it so its only right i like this topic
i’ll be on a hill keeping my head above water
i can’t afford to ever get caught in a corner
so i move with the force of a sorcerer
it’s dark when i’m about just me myself and my shadow
im parro running out of ammo and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so it’s narrow
the less then the better a more proof for the last one left so they dont leave me as wet as an umbrella
i play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess im clever
how can i be at my best with this pressure
i got a lot to loose but when i watch the news my mind’s infected with terror
no wonder i’m under stress i got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
and when they left it looked like i had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
i should of bust the back door and jump the fence
it easy when you look back shoulda woulda coulda but i bet you can’t bring should woulda could back
back to fifteen i said to myself that i’m more than a hood track
ooo you can drag me in the deep ends
ooo but you will never drown me out
ooo you can drag me in the deep ends
ooo but you will never drown me out out out
you won’t drown me out out out
you won’t drown me out
you can’t ever drown me out the water supplies too low
and im around about 61 10 stone
ive never seen someone drown without a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
a violent mc my mouth can vouch
do i sound like i’m choking seriously do i sound like i’m joking
i’m floating even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
but i am a ship thats sunk many years i’m maintaining
plain sailing no commotion
like a dolphin when it’s in motion
but i cant break me so why would i show them i’m broken
no real shit throw my skin ain’t close to corrosion
fuck em all this aint tug of war still dont get roped in the open i don’t wanna reveal my violent side
but i swear that i will soon if the lord above dont provide a sign
then i’ma kill you arm for arm eye for eye
nah i just wanna live my life but you don’t wanna see this guy survive
ooo you can drag me in the deep ends
ooo but you will never drown me out
ooo you can drag me in the deep ends
ooo but you will never drown me out out out
you won’t drown me out
you won’t drown me out
ooo you can drag me in the deep ends
ooo but you will never drown me out
ooo you can drag me in the deep ends
ooo but you will never drown me out out out
you won’t drown me out
you won’t drown me out
i wanna be drunk when i wake up
on the right side of the wrong bed
and never an excuse i made up
tell you the truth i hate
what didnt kill me
it never made me stronger at all
love will scar your make up
lips sticks to me so now i maybe lean back there
im sat here wishing i was sober
i know ill never hold you like i used to
but a house gets cold when you cut the heating
without you to hold ill be freezing
cant rely on my heart to beat in
cause you take parts of it every evening
take words out of my mouth just from breathing
replace with phrases like when you leaving me 
should i should i
maybe ill get drunk again
ill be drunk again ill be drunk again
to feel a little love
i wanna hold your heart in both hands
not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
and i got no plans for the weekend so should we speak then
keep it between friends
though i know youll never love me like you used to
there may be other people like us
who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
flames just create us but burns dont heal like before
and you dont hold me anymore
on cold days cold plays out like the bands name
i know i cant heal things with a handshake
you know i can change as i began saying
you cut me wide open like landscape
open bottles of beer but never champagne
to applaud you with the sound that my hands make
should i should i
maybe ill get drunk again
ill be drunk again ill be drunk again
to feel a little love
all by myself im here again
all by myself you know ill never change
all by myself
all by myself
im just drunk again
ill be drunk again
ill be drunk again
to feel a little love
well get up up on the dancefloor tonight
ive got two left feet and a bottle of red wine

i heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
goes to the gym at least six times a week
wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
and i heard hes on a new diet and watches what he eats
hes got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
owns every single ministry cd
tribal tattoos and he dont know what it means
but i heard he makes you happy so thats fine by me
but still im just keeping it real still looking at your instagram and ill be creeping a little
ill be trying not to double tap from way back cause i know thats where the troubles at
let me remind you of the days when you used to hold my hand
and when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
i guess if you were lois lane i wasnt superman just a young boy trying to be loved
so let me give it to you
i dont wanna know about your new man cause if it was meant to be
you wouldnt be calling me up trying to
cause im positive that he dont wanna know about me
i dont wanna know about your new man well get there eventually
i know youre missing all this kind of love
but im positive that he dont wanna know about me
your new man rents a house in the burb and wears a man bag on his shoulder but i call it a purse
every year he goes to malaga with all the fellas drinks beer but has a six pack im kind of jealous
he wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime and every time a rap song comes on
he makes a gun sign says chune boydem light up the room
but enough about him girl lets talk about you
you were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading
eating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating
now youre eating kale hitting the gym keeping up with kylie  kim
in the back of the club kissing a boy that aint him
ok you need to be alone and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone
i just thought that i would tell you cause you oughta know
youre still a young girl trying to be loved
so let me give it to you
i dont wanna know about your new man cause if it was meant to be
you wouldnt be calling me up trying to
cause im positive that he dont wanna know about me
i dont wanna know about your new man well get there eventually
i know youre missing all this kind of love
but im positive that he dont wanna know about me
baby im not trying to ruin your week
but you act so differently
when youre with him i know youre lonely
please remember youre still free to make the choice and leave
and dont call me up you need to show me
i dont wanna know about your new man cause if it was meant to be
you wouldnt be calling me up trying to
cause im positive that he dont wanna know about me
i dont wanna know about your new man well get there eventually
i know youre missing all this kind of love
but im positive that he dont wanna know about me
know about me know know about me
i dont wanna know about your new man he dont wanna know
i should ink my skin with your name
and take my passport out again
and just replace it
see i could do without a tan
on my left hand
where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
and i should run you a hot bath
and fill it up with bubbles
cause maybe youre lovable
and maybe youre my snowflake
when your eyes turn from green to gray
in the winter ill hold you in a cold place
and you should never cut your hair
cause i love the way you flick it off your shoulder
and you will never know
just how beautiful you are to me
but maybe im just in love
when you wake me up
and would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way
and i know you love shrek
cause weve watched it 12 times
but maybe youre hoping for a fairy tale too
and if your dvd breaks today
you shouldve got a vcr
because ive never owned a bluray true say
and now ive always been shit at computer games
and your brother always beats me
and if i lost id go across and chuck all the controllers at the tv
and then youd laugh at me
and be asking me
if im gonna be home next week
and then youd lie with me til i fall asleep
and flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets
and you will never know
just how beautiful you are to me
but maybe im just in love
when you wake me up
and i think you hate the smell of smoke
you always try get me to stop
but you drink as much as me
and i get drunk a lot
so ill take you to the beach
and walk along the sand
and ill make you a heart pendant
with a pebble held in my hand
and ill carve it like a necklace
so the heart falls where your chest is
and now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
and it falls just where it needs to be
and rests peacefully
so you just need to breathe
to feel my heart against yours now against yours now
cause maybe im just in love when you wake me up
or maybe im just in love when you wake me up
maybe i fell in love when you woke me up
oh misty eye of the mountain below
keep careful watch of my brothers souls
and should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
keep watching over durins sons
if this is to end in fire
then we should all burn together
watch the flames climb high into the night
calling out father oh
stand by and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on
the mountain side
and if we should die tonight
then we should all die together
raise a glass of wine for the last time
calling out father oh
prepare as we will
watch the flames burn auburn on
the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky
now i see fire
inside the mountain
i see fire
burning the trees
and i see fire
hollowing souls
i see fire
blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me
oh should my people fall
then surely ill do the same
confined in mountain halls
we got too close to the flame
calling out father oh
hold fast and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on
the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky
now i see fire
inside the mountain
i see fire
burning the trees
i see fire
hollowing souls
i see fire
blood in the breeze
and i hope that you remember me
and if the night is burning
i will cover my eyes
for if the dark returns
then my brothers will die
and as the sky is falling down
it crashed into this lonely town
and with that shadow upon the ground
i hear my people screaming out
now i see fire
inside the mountains
i see fire
burning the trees
i see fire
hollowing souls
i see fire
blood in the breeze
i see fire 
oh you know i saw a city burning out
and i see fire 
feel the heat upon my skin yeah
and i see fire 
uhuhuhuh
and i see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
now im in town break it down thinking of making a new sound
playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
thats you now ciao seems that life is great now
see me lose focus as i sing to you loud
and i cant no i wont hush
ill say the words that make you blush
im gonna sing this now
see im true my songs are where my heart is
im like glue i stick to other artists
im not you now that would be disastrous
let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
see im real i do it all its all me
im not fake dont ever call me lazy
i wont stay put give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me
i sing and write my own tune and i write my own verse
hell dont need another wordsmith to make my tune sell
call yourself a singerwriter
youre just bluffing
names on the credits and you didnt write nothing
i sing fast i know that all my shits cool
i will blast and i didnt go to brit school
i came fast with the way i act right
i cant last if im smoking on a crack pipe
and i wont be a product of my genre
my mind will always be stronger than my songs are
never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
always read the stories that you hear on wikipedia
and musically im demonstrating
when i perform live feels like i am meditating
times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
a young singerwriter like gabriella cilmi
cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me
cause with the lyrics ill be aiming it right
i wont stop til my names in lights
at stadium heights with damien rice
on red carpets now im on arabian nights
because im young i know my brothers gonna give me advice
longnighter short height and i gone hyper
never be anything but a singersongwriter
the games over but now im on a new level
watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal
cause people think that im bound to blow up
ive done around about a thousand shows
but i havent got a house plus i live on the couch
so you believe the lyrics when im singing them out wow
from day one ive been prepared
with vo5 wax for my ginger hair
so now im back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
cause its another day plus
ill keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
into another rappers shoes using new laces
im selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
nationwide tour with just jack still had to get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
i hit back when the pen hurts me
im still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
im still the same as a year ago
but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
im always doing shows if im not im in the studio
truly broke never growing up call me ruffio
melody music maker
reading all the papers
they say im up and coming like im fucking in an elevator
cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me
still got a rucksack for the old clothes
i rap with the cold flows
im back with the old jokes
in fact you dont know
on tracks i throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
if you cant keep up youll get none youre celibate
man flows developing
skin lacks the melanin
give me a shot of adrenaline and i get it in
i do it for the hell of it
cause ever since i hit the mainstream with the a team
i seem to sell a bit
i took what held me back with the women
and then i packaged the image
put in some content
and then i sold it back as a gimmick
the fact is this
ill end up dating actresses
wake up on dirty mattresses
i think i need to practice this
but i make shit happen call me a laxative
worlds on my shoulders
i dont even know what atlas is
hard parts sharp like a cactus is
im back to rapping back to back
cause ive been practicing
im back to sing this
cause you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you
you need me man i dont need you at all
you need me man i dont need you
i met you when i was a teen
but then you were one as well
and i could play a guitar
just like ringing a bell
sometimes i wonder
in any other summer
could you have been my parttime lover to me
listening to stevie wonder
under the covers where we used to lay
stacks is what the speakers played
id be on tour almost every day
when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
just watching a dvd smoking illegal weed
getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
we used each others air just for the people to see
and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
wed go anywhere our minds would take us
and ill say you are beautiful without your makeup
and you dont even need to worry about your weight cause
we can all be loved the way that god made us
and times the only reason that we could break up
cause you would always tell me im away too much
distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake
so say it again
oh nina you should go nina
cause i aint ever coming home nina
oh wont you leave me now
and ive been livin on the road nina
but then again you should know nina
cause thats you and me both nina
oh wont you leave me now now
and every weekend in the winter youd be wearing my hoodie
with drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
taking day trips to the local where wed eat on our own
cause every day when i was away wed only speak on the phone
watching blue planet creating new habits
acting as if we were two rabbits
and then youd vanish
back to the borough with all the celtics
i disappear you call me selfish
i understand but i cant help it
i put my job over everything except my family and friends
but youll be in between forever so i guess well have to take a step back
overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
and im not saying we should be taking a break
just reevaluate quick before we make a mistake and its too late
so we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
but in a day well have to say it again
oh nina you should go nina
cause i aint ever coming home nina
oh wont you leave me now
and ive been livin on the road nina
but then again you should know nina
cause thats you and me both nina
oh wont you leave me now now
love will come and love will go
but you can make it on your own
sing that song
go oh wont you leave me now
people grow and fall apart
but you can mend your broken heart
take it back go oh wont you leave me now
oh nina you should go nina
cause i aint ever coming home nina
oh wont you leave me now
and ive been livin on the road nina
but then again you should know nina
cause thats you and me both nina
oh wont you leave me now now
tell me that you turned down the man
who asks for your hand
cause youre waiting for me
and i know youre gonna be away a while
but ive got no plans at all to leave
and would you take away my hopes and dreams and just stay with me
all my senses come to life
while im stumbling home as drunk as i
have ever been and ill never leave again
cause you are the only one
and all my friends have gone to find
another place to let their hearts collide
cause you are the only one
take my hand and my
heart and soul i will
only have these eyes for you
and you know everything changes but
well be strangers if we see this through
you could stay within these walls and bleed or just stay with me
oh lord now
all my senses come to life
while im stumbling home as drunk as i
have ever been and ill never leave again
cause you are the only one
and all my friends have gone to find
another place to let their hearts collide
just promise me youll always be a friend
cause you are the only one
stumbling half drunk getting myself lost
i am so gone so tell me the way home
i listen to sad songs singing about love
and where it goes wrong
all my senses come to life
while im stumbling home as drunk as i
have ever been and ill never leave again
cause you are the only one
and all my friends have gone to find
another place to let their hearts collide
just promise me youll always be a friend
cause you are the only one
i gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
i gave away my money and now we dont even speak
i drove miles and miles but would you do the same for me
oh honestly
offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon
gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
they gave me the heartache and in return i gave a song
it goes on and on
life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels
i drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell
so before i save someone else ive got to save myself
i gave you all my energy and i took away your pain
cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
what line do we stand upon cause from here it looks the same
and only scars remain
life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels
i drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell
so before i save someone else ive got to save myself
but if i dont then ill go back to where im rescuing a stranger
just because they needed saving just like that
oh im here again between the devil and the danger
but i guess its just my nature
my dad was wrong cause im not like my mum
cause shed just smile and im complaining in a song but it helps
so before i save someone else ive got to save myself
life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels
or drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf no farewell
so before i save someone else ive got to save myself
and before i blame someone else ive got to save myself
and before i love someone else ive got to love myself
loving can hurt
loving can hurt sometimes
but its the only thing that i know
when it gets hard
you know it can get hard sometimes
it is the only thing that makes us feel alive
we keep this love in a photograph
we made these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closing
hearts are never broken
times forever frozen still
so you can keep me
inside the pocket
of your ripped jeans
holdin me closer
til our eyes meet
you wont ever be alone
wait for me to come home
loving can heal
loving can mend your soul
and its the only thing that i know 
i swear it will get easier
remember that with every piece of ya
and its the only thing we take with us when we die
we keep this love in a photograph
we made these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closing
hearts were never broken
times forever frozen still
so you can keep me
inside the pocket
of your ripped jeans
holdin me closer
til our eyes meet
you wont ever be alone
and if you hurt me
thats ok baby only words bleed
inside these pages you just hold me
and i wont ever let you go
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
oh you can fit me
inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
next to your heartbeat
where i should be
keep it deep within your soul
and if you hurt me
well thats ok baby only words bleed
inside these pages you just hold me
and i wont ever let you go
when im away
i will remember how you kissed me
under the lamppost
back on 6th street
hearing you whisper through the phone
wait for me to come home
ooh ooh whoa oh oh oh now now
five drinks in on friday night
we only came to dry your eyes
and get you out of your room
now this bar has closed its doors
i found my hand is holding yours
do you wanna go home so soon
or maybe we should take a ride
through the night
and sing along to every song
thats on the radio
in the back of a taxi cab in brooklyn no no no
the sun could rise
burning all the street lamps out at 3 am
so dj play it again
until the night turns into morning
youll be in my arms
and well just keep driving
along the boulevard
and if i kissed you darling
please dont be alarmed
its just the start of everything
if you want a new love in new york
yesterday gave me a call
stressing out about it all
said the world is moving too fast
and you dont know where to begin
cause youve spent a lifetime fitting in
only to wind up on the other side
by yourself
and every day
screaming out
to all the people that you used to know
from a window that looks upon manhattan skyline
its just the way that life goes
and you hear it in every song you know
so dj play it again
until the night turns into morning
youll be in my arms
and well just keep driving
along the boulevard
and if i kissed you darling
please dont be alarmed
its just the start of everything
if you want a new life in new york
and every song that plays
is just like the day you had
and its okay to cry
but im saying maybe thats a waste of water
you know im here for you
in the back of the taxi cab tonight in new york
its just reached the morning
and youre still in my arms
and weve stopped driving
down the boulevard
and i just kissed you darling
i hope you werent alarmed
its just the start of everything
that you want
a new love in new york
a new life in new york
no i dont wanna hate you
just wish youd never gone for the man
and waited two weeks at least
before you let him take you
i stayed true
i kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
hes waiting for the time to move
i knew he had his eyes on you
hes not the right guy for you
dont hate me cause i write the truth
no i would never lie to you
but it was never fine to lose you
and what a way to find out
it never came from my mouth
you never changed your mind
but you were just afraid to mind out
but fuck it i wont be changing the subject i love it
ill make your little secret public its nothing
im just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
trapped and im lacking sleep
fact is youre mad at me because i backtrack so casually
youre practically my family
if we married then ill guess youd have to be
but tragically our love just lost the will to live
but would i kill to give it one more shot
i think not
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont want you no
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont wanna love you no
recently i tend to zone out
up in my headphones to holocene
you promised your body but im away so much
i stay more celibate than in a monastery
im not cut out for life on the road
cause i didnt know id miss you this much
and at the time wed just go so sue me
i guess im not the man that you need
ever since you went to uni
ive been sofa surfing with a rucksack
full of less cash and i guess that could get bad
but when i broke the industry
thats when i broke your heart
i was supposed to chart and celebrate
but good things are over fast
i know its hard to deal with and see this
i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
then i turn the music off
and all im left with is to pick up my personal pieces jesus
i never really want to believe this
got advice from my dad and he
told me that family is all ill ever have and need
i guess im unaware of it
success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont want you no
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont wanna love you no
and since you left
ive given up my days off
its what i need to stay strong
i know you have a day job
but mine is 247
i feel like writing a book
i guess i lied in the hook
cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could
the irony is if my career and music didnt exist
in 6 years yeah youd probably be my wife with a kid
im frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink
and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and its
just hiding my misguiding thoughts that im trying to kill
and id be writing my will before im 27
ill die from a thrill
go down in history as just a wasted talent
can i face the challenge
or did i make a mistake erasing
its only therapy
my thoughts just get ahead of me
eventually ill be fine i know that it was never meant to be
either way i guess im not prepared
but ill say this
these things happen for a reason and you cant change shit
take my apology
im sorry for the honesty
but i had to get this off my chest
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont want you no
i dont love you baby
i dont need you baby
i dont wanna love you no
bibia be ye ye
i lost my shoes last night
i dont know where i put my keys
i was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
i bet my mothers proud of me from each scar upon my knuckle
and each graze upon my knee and all i know is
i got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
he kicked me out and then i walked in the rain
i tell myself in every way i wont be doing this again

and in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
my heart is breaking at the seams
and im coming apart now
now things are looking up ill find my shoes right next to the oak tree
and ill get a bus straight into town
and spend the afternoon looking around for the things that i left on the ground
and say youre with me tomorrows a brand new day

treat me beneath this clear night sky
and i will lie with you
i start to feel those butterflies
when im next to you
tell me your secrets
give me a friend
let all the good times flood in
do i love you
do i hate you
i cant make up my mind
so lets freefall
see where we land
its been this way since we were young
well fight and then make up
ill breathe your air into my lungs
when i feel your touch
tell me your secrets
give me a friend
let all the good times flood in
do i love you
do i hate you
i cant make up my mind
so lets freefall
and see where we land
tada ra ra
tada ra ra
tada ra ra
tada ra ra
tada ra ra
tada ra ra
tell me your secrets
give me a friend
let all the good times flood in
do i love you
do i hate you
i cant make up my mind
so lets freefall
and see where we land
hmm let me go
to see my family
please father let me go
as my mother sleeps
i dont know about james bond
but round here nobody live twice
when youre gone youre gone without no bye
cause only a judge can give you life
this is my advice
trust me i nearly lost my life
3 weeks after i got this ride
pissed like i had way too much wine
i wished that i didnt get one
anyway i was going to the macbeth booked for a set
even though i didnt have a set one
scream hit the decks i was like check one
put on a show but it werent my best one
left it dropped off blacks at his destination
then i was off to the next one
20 minutes later i was on the m1
but i kept on going
fell asleep without even knowing
no emotion in my face
no movement in my legs but the car still kept going
i was in so much pain
crawled out of a megane that now looked like a mini
when i was still on the first lane
baffled didnt even know my name
fainted too much shock in my brain
surrounded by paramedics and feds
trying to get up but fainted again
see i just want you to take a second hear me out
dont think im happy cause i smile when you see me out
ive had serious madness is where ive nearly disappeared
oh im begging lord to save me and let me go
to see my family
and keep it inside
dry eyes while my brother weeps
save my soul
please father let me go
keep me safe as my mother sleeps
eyes closed they just wouldnt open
i can hear voices and my phone ringing
fighting for life cant tell if im winning
one of the worst situations ive been in
i can hear all of the angels singing
but when it stopped humming
my brain turned on started running
still in pain but it started numbing
the stone cold comeback i made was stunning
i still tried to do a few shows cause i didnt wanna tell them that i werent coming
but i was left with a permanent problem
nobody knows about the pain that im inside
ever so cunning
6 weeks later jogging and running
i used the first aid kit like a drum set
picked up the tools and i gave it a drumming
trust me when it comes to mistakes
you cant afford to let one in
never done dream for a while
the pipeline was blocked
so i learnt and done a bit of plumbing
they say tomorrow never dies
but he forgot to tell you you can
you can have a sicker clan than wutang
but when your times up thats it its you fam
you can try beg for another
sometimes ill be on my way to a show
thinking i just wanna see my brother
then do a uturn im gone runner
see i just want you to take a second hear me out
dont think im happy cause i smile when you see me out
ive had serious madness is where ive nearly disappeared
oh im begging lord to save me and let me go
to see my family
and keep it inside
dry eyes while my brother weeps
save my soul
please father let me go
keep me safe
⟔as my mother sleeps
and let me go to see my family
and keep it inside
dry eyes while my brother weeps
save my soul
please father let me go
and keep me safe⟓
this is the start of something beautiful
this is the start of something new
you are the one whod make me lose it all
you are the start of something new ooh
and ill throw it all away
and watch you fall into my arms again
and ill throw it all away
watch you fall now
you are the earth that i will stand upon
you are the words that i will sing
and ive thrown it all away
and watched you fall into his arms again
and ive thrown it all away
watched you fall now
and take me back
take me home
watch me fall
down to earth
take me back for
this is the start of something beautiful
you are the start of something new
across the sea
by the tennessee skyline
they told me id find my
hopes and my dreams
but i long to be
in the bed of my true love
back where i came from
shes waiting for me
so ill make my way
through long winding country roads
but my heart still beats
for my home and my english rose
i told my dad
on the phone its amazing
from the straight to the craziest places ive seen
but i long to be
in the arms of my true love
like he loves my mother
he understands me
ill spend my days
just travelling and playing shows
but my heart still beats
for my home and my english rose
i met a man
in a bar down in memphis
he told me he went there to follow his dreams
he told me son
you know i lost my true love
for the same exact reason
that you crossed the sea
and i found truth
in people i barely know
but my heart still beats for my home and my english rose
oh my heart still beats for my home and my english rose
oh my heart still beats for my home and my english rose
and happy days
that left us on the floor
and you breathe me
til youre not feeling sure
everything will brighten up
if we go to brighton
ill take you along the pier
everything will lighten up
if you feel too frightened
ill make things disappear dear
darling dont be nervous
ill understand if you let me go
i did this on purpose
now cause when im missing you
ill stop eating food
and ill squeeze into a dress
so i can be like you
and then ill see your bitterness
and why youre leaving too
maybe ill put you to a test
and say that i love you
i think that i love you
and sunny days
that left my skin dark red
and you squeeze me
til these thoughts leave my head
if it gets too complicated
ill give up and be frustrated
can you see whats wrong
if you feel like youve been hated
this loves too overrated
see whats going on mmm
darling dont be nervous
ill understand if you let me go
i did this on purpose
now cause when im missing you
ill stop eating food
and ill squeeze into a dress
so i can be like you
and then ill see your bitterness
and why youre leaving too
maybe ill put you to a test
and say that i love you
i think that i love you
take me back to live at home
take me back to albert road
now im missing you
ill stop eating food
and ill squeeze into your dress
so i can feel like you
but then i saw your bitterness
and why you left me too
i thought id put you to a test
and say that i love you
i think that i love you
and ill stop eating food
and ill squeeze into your dress
so i can feel like you
but then i saw your bitterness
and why you left me too
i thought i put you to a test
and say that i love you
now it seems you loved me too
can you hear me
i just wanted to let you know
i hope you can hear what i write to you
how could i say goodbye to you
when im a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
i gotta respect the way you provided food for the whole fam
you came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
cold double 8 8 kids bare wheels
plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
just locked in a cage slaving
they said they were gold in the pavements
but you came and saw the road to amazement
broke your heart
but still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
i hope your listening right
i still think of you every sunday
no one can top your chicken and rice
even through the darkness times
you held us all up because your vision was bright
i knew your strength was your wisdom inside
you never let anyone see your heartache
you just got on with it
anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
and your words you would stand strong with it
cause they were like warmth on a winter night
but i was just too young to go on with it
and there somethings i could try to do
but its an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
i couldnt do that i owe my life to you
and of the pieces of my soul
you know i never want to be aloohohone
i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
and will you think of me up there
can i say goodbye to you
and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace
can i say goodbye to you ohh
i think you phoney
i was younger with the knowledge of things that i know now
i would be by your side when you needed me
instead of asking you nan can i go out 
standing in a road with the gangs that i know now
everyones missing you loads jessicas grown up
warreen lauren and alex are fine and im living with hope
its been a while since ive seen c and the mouths
i miss seeing a family being a family
and us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
but as time goes by the bridge seems longer
family problems have never been funny
in my heart the only one that dissed me was sonia
she took all our inheritance money
left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
i never forgive the way she betrayed us
there aint a big enough reason
before i sell out my fam ill be giving up breathing
but i guess that everyones different
or should i say no ones perfect
she had happiness in front of her
but chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
since you gone the foundations crumbled
so building it back up is my next step
i got all the bricks and the cement but
its hard when its done i dont know what to expect
so give me the strength that i need to perform this task
make it right i must do
and i ask cause i trust you
it goes way beyond a song when i say i love you
and of the pieces of my soul
you know i never wanna be aloohohone
i can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
and will you think of me up there
can i say goodbye to you
and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace
can i say goodbye to you ohh
its just for now so i should hush
ill never get enough ill see you when i see you but
i miss you
ohh how i miss you
its just for now so i should hush
ill never get enough ill see you when i see you but
i miss you
ohh how i miss you
there aint enough words to describe
how sorry i am for the pain that i caused
sorry for when i stuck up my own blood
we were young and he said it was rapeing his broad
and for the day police came to the door
im sorry for being such a bad youth
stealing from your purse and making you mourn
i never been able to say this before
cause i was so inconsiderate
you loved me unconditionally
and i took advantage of it like a idiot
not seeing the pure soul that i was living with
i really hope that you can forgive me
you going away was a punishment
but i wont let go im holding you with me
but i still fight the emotions within me
i can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
and will you think of me up there
and can i say goodbye to you
and paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
feel the chill of your warm embrace
and can i say goodbye to you
i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
and will you think of me up there
can i say goodbye to you
and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace
can i say goodbye to you
