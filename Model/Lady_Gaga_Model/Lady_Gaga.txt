and i dont wanna break the heart of any other man
but you but you

but its as good as good as good as good as gold
got a baby sister who looks just like me
she wants nothing more than a man to please
maybe shes in too deep
her love for him aint cheap
but it breaks just like a knockoff piece
from fulton street
the mans got a gift for getting what he wants
hes thirsty when he drinks
gets on the brink and throws her off
i get on my knees and beg you
hear my sinners prayer
i am what i am
and i dont wanna break the heart of any other man
but you but you
hear my sinners prayer
its the only one i know
it sure as hell dont rhyme
but its as good as good as good as good as gold
good as good as good as good as gold
i can carry you but not your ghosts
wish i had the faith but i dont know oh
hear my sinners prayer
i am what i am
and i dont wanna break the heart of any other man
but you but you
hear my sinners prayer
its the only one i know
it sure as hell dont rhyme
but its as good as good as good as good as gold
good as good as good as good as gold
good as good as good as good as gold
i know that we are young
and i know that you may love me
but i just cant be with you like this anymore
