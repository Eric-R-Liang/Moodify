i reached heights that dwight howard couldnt reach nigga
prince akeem they throw flowers at my feet nigga
i could go a hour on this beat nigga

but thats still the boss dont get sent for
get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasnt meant for
cause you dont really wanna hear me vent more
hot temper scary outcome
heres a reason for niggas thats hatin without one
that always let they mouth run
bench players talkin like starters i hate it
started from the bottom now we here nigga we made it
yeah tom ford tuscan leather smelling like a brick
degenerates but even ellen love our shit
rich enough that i dont have to tell em that im rich
self explanatory you just here to spread the story wassup
sittin gucci row like they say up at unlv
young rebel young money nothin you could tell me
paperwork takin too long maybe they dont understand me
ill compromise if i have to i gotta stay with the family
not even talkin to nicki communication is breakin
i dropped the ball on some personal shit i need to embrace it
im honest i make mistakes id be the second to admit it
think thats why i need her in my life to check me when im trippin
on a mission tryna shift the culture
tell me who dissin i got some things thatll hit the culprit
them strep throat flows them shits to stop all of the talkin
all of the talkin got one reply for all of your comments
fuck what you think im too busy thats why you leave a message
born a perfectionist guess that makes me a bit obsessive
that shit i heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
like aye b i got your cd you get an e for effort
i piece letters together and get to talkin reckless
i dont change like credentials you know you see the necklace
my lifes a completed checklist
im tired of hearin bout who you checkin for now
just give it time well see whos still around a decade from now
thats real
how much time is this nigga spendin on the intro
lately ive been feelin like guy pearce in memento
i just set the bar niggas fall under it like a limbo
the family all that matters im just out here with my kinfolk
off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow
this for shorty up on glengrove who love when i catch my tempo
i sip the pora and listen to cappadonna
the fresh prince just had dinner with tatiana no lie
all these 90s fantasies on my mind
the difference is that with mine they all come true in due time
i might come through without security to check if youre fine
thats just me on my solo like fuck it like yolo
wanted to tell you accept yourself
you dont have to prove shit to no one except yourself
and if you end up needing some extra help then i can help
you know back on your feet and shit
tryna get my karma up fuck the guilty and greedy shit
how much time is this nigga spendin on the intro
how this nigga workin like he got a fuckin twin though
life is soundin crazy 40 on martin scorcese
and i wouldnt change a thing if you payed me now real nigga wassup
all we wanted was opportunity
just blaze lord knows
it’s your worst nightmare it’s my first night here
and this girl right here who knows what she knows
so i’m going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
and her purse right there i don’t trust these hoes at all
but that’s just the result of me paying attention
to all these women that think like men with the same intentions
talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
even a couple pornstars that i’m ashamed to mention
but weezy and stunna are my only role models
heffer and jordan are my only role models
that’s why i walk around with all this gold on
and every time i run into these niggas they want no problems
buy them sixes and chains and some bracelets and rings
all of the little accents that make me a king
i never hear the disses they try and point out to me
but it’s whatever if somebody wan’ make it a thing
i’m more concerned what niggas thinkin’ about christmas in august
do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
get some shake a brick in the press
and chef it like mrs
fields they’re making the cookie stretch
i know it so well i know the hustle so well
stunt like i’m workin’ overnighters right by the motel
drug money outfit record clean
spend it all on me and my fuckin’ team
matchin’ rollies for real matchin’ rovers for real
places they say they’ve been we’ve actually going for real
i’m really killin’ shit fuck all the jiggy rappin’
i’m going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
mixtape legend underground kings
lookin’ for the right way to do the wrong things
with my new bitch that’s living in palm springs
young ass nigga lifelong dreams
they take the greats from the past and compare us
i wonder if they’d ever survive in this era
in a time where it’s recreation
to pull all your skeletons out the closet like halloween decorations
i know of all the things that i hear they be pokin’ fun at
never the flow though they know i run that
fuck you all i claim that whenever
i change rap forever the game back together yup
ym i remain that forever
in the same place my brother wayne that forever
i’m a descendent of either marley or hendrix
i haven’t figured it out cause my story is far from finished
i’m hearing all of the jokes i know that they tryna push me
i know that showin’ emotion don’t ever mean i’m a pussy
know that i don’t make music for niggas who don’t get pussy
so those are the ones i count on to diss me or overlook me
lord knows lord knows i’m heavy i got my weight up
roll this and boost your rate up it’s time that somebody paid up
a lot of niggas came up off of a style that i made up
but if all i hear is me then who should i be afraid of
bought a white ghost now shit is gettin’ spooky
very very scary like shit you see in the movies
in this bitch all drinks on the house like snoopy
that’s why all the real soldiers salute me
trill nigga for real
you know i love this
yolo you only live once
i’m going so hard my nigga i swear homie
everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal
i fell in love with the pen started fucking in ink
the hustle’s an art i paint it what i would think
still allergic to broke prescription straight to the paper
destined for greatness but got a place in jamaica
villa on the water with the wonderful views
only fat nigga in the sauna with jews
went and got a yacht i’m talkin’ carnival cruise
and these niggas talkin like hoes they mad they not in my shoes
it’s the red bottom boss came to buy the bar
every by week shit i’m bound to buy a car
murdercedes benz of that bubble double r
headlights flickin’ lookin’ like a fallin’ star
everyday them hammers bang whippin yay like anna mae
i run the game but the ladies think i’m running game
mink coats making women wanna fornicate
rosay and drake i’m gettin’ cake nothin’ short of great

the game needed life i put my heart in it
i blew myself up im on some martyr shit

its happening penny lane just like you said
i avoided the coke game and went with sprite instead
uh huh thats word to the millions that they putting up
im trying to do better than good enough
what am i afraid of this is suppose to be what dreams are made of
but people i dont have the time to hang with always look at me and say the same shit
they say
you promised me you would never change
you promised me you would never change
am i wrong for making light of my situation clap on

like im high right now the guy right now and you can tell by looking in my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we just having the time of our lives right now
what am i afraid of this is suppose to be what dreams are made of
but people i dont have the time to hang with always look at me and say the same shit
they say
you promised me you would never change
you promised you would never change
well all right
i live by some advices girl lisa told me
the other day lisa told that she missed the old me
which made me question when i went missing
and when i start treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast paced switch up
or the two guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause the girl i thought i trusted was who set the whole shit up
or the fact i havent seen em since they locked big rich up
at the same time im quick to forget
im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it all burn it all im starting it fresh
cause half the time i got it right i probably guessed
did i just trade free time for camera time
will i blow all of this money baby hammer time
i just need some closure

you know hun im a bit concerned about this negative tone that im hearing in your voice these days
i can appreciate where your uncertainly stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust
but that attitude will just hold you back in this life and youre going to continue to feel alienated
give some thought to this because im confident in you and i know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation im hearing in your tone these days

people around you should really have nothing to say
me i’m just proud of the fact that you’ve done it your way
and the weekends here started it right
even if you only get part of it right
live for today plan for tomorrow
party tonight party tonight
dying to meet your girlfriends
that you said you might bring
if they’re the ones that tell you that you do the right thing
houston girls love the way it goes down
atlanta girls love the way it goes down
vegas girls love the way it goes down
but i gotta say oh babe oh babe why is this so familiar
just met already feel like i know the real her
you must’ve done this before this can’t be your first time
we must’ve been here before it’s still fresh on my mind
you got that shit that somebody would look for but won’t find
you must’ve done this before this can’t be your first time
they keep telling me don’t save you
if i ignore all that advice
then something isn’t right
then who will i complain to
but the weekends here started it right
even if i only get part of it right
live for today plan for tomorrow
party tonight party tonight
you got your guards up i do too
there’s things we might discover
cause you got a past and i do too we’re perfect for each other
cause to her i’m just a rapper and soon she’ll have met another
so if tonight’s an accident tomorrow we’ll recover
and i know i’m not supposed to judge a book by its cover
i don’t wanna be in the blind but sometimes i stevie wonder
about her and she with it if i’m with it and i’m with it
i know what makes her smile but i won’t know what makes her different
or should i just be realistic lipstick on the glass
i know this ain’t your first but it’s better than your last
shower her with dollar tips
shawty went and bought a whip
guarantee the city remember your whole name
you throw that ho a scholarship
all of them aint all equipped
and this saddens me i see the pecking order
quoteunquote bad bitches work the whole floor
those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
like a lab rat nobody want her
niggas that are married dont wanna go home
but we look up to them they wish they were us
they want some new trim
we lust for some trust
now the both of us are colorblind
cause the other side looks greener
which leaves your turf in the boise state
cant see her play or the team cuz
everybody has an addiction
mine happens to be you
and those who say they dont
souls will later on say to them that aint true
all of them will have an opinion
but yall know what you can do with them
but if you unsure ill take you on tour
to a place you can stick that in
well sitting here sad as hell
listening to adele i feel you baby
someone like you more like someone unlike you
or something thats familiar maybe
and i can tell that she wants a baby
and i can yell girl that youre crazy
oh what the hell nope cant be lazy
please be careful
bitches got the rabies
money just changed everything i wonder how life without it would go
from the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
lookin down from the top and its crowded below
my fifteen minutes started an hour ago
truth over fame you know i respect the blatant shit
when i hear them talking i just dont know what to make of it
hate is so familiar to me im slowly embracing it
doesnt come natural bear with me it could take a bit
yeah and my dreams are who im racing with
and you can see im pacing it so that im always chasing it
wayne put me right here thats who i get the paper with
i hope that my success never alters our relationship
yeah this life is something i would die for
octobers own but its looking like july 4
i just wish theyd let you try it first
this time im really going off fireworks
today it begins
i missed them before but wont miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think that i just realized what it means
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off like fireworks
im just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how im placing all my napkins and my cutlery
i could tell it wasnt love i just thought you fuck with me
who couldve predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me
damn i kept my wits about me luckily
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
but i was curious and ill never forget it baby
what an experience
you couldve been the one but it wasnt that serious
there was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it
that felt good all and all i learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah i shouldve looked up in the sky at first
now i can see it in her eyes
fireworks
everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that i still listen
and hes still got his foot out guilt trippin
its been years though i just learn to deal with it
for real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city i let her explore
and now shes sayin shes more lonely than ever before
how many of our parents marriages lasted
i was only 5 i bet i barely reacted
im flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic
lets stay together til were ghosts
i want to witness love ive never seen it close
yeah but i guess i gotta find it first thats why im really going off
fireworks

wise words from a decent man
back when i was trying to put a ring on alicia hand
this lost boy got fly without peter pan
and my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man
in person i am everything and more
im everywhere these other niggas never been before
but inside im treading waters steady trying to swim ashore
im on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store
just call me shop and bag drizzy
and call me mr
damn he aint coping that is he
and fans of these freshman is about to get iffy
while this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy
im a kill it i promise this i know you mad
ive always treated my city like some shoulder pads
to big homie use a flash if you must
and i swear i aint asking for much
all i want is
i want the money
money and the cars
cars and the clothes
the hoes
i suppose
i just wanna be
i just wanna be

its like i know what i got to say
i just dont know how to say it to you
pardon the swag
but bitches cartate
long bread i dont eat shortcake
how come i cant
miss a woman like i cant miss court dates
but shes not in this portrait
lifes fine but i don not portray
im on the other side but it is a short gate
i dont want the glow
i want the glow ray
and im a fuck the world
but this is just foreplay
tired of hearing bullshit
bring her on to cowshit
havent met a smell thats stinkier than our shit
thats word to toronto
so high up i got birds in the condo
aint that a female dog
ask her who i am to her
and she yell god
weezy baby i go real hard
no further details boy
you could thank me now
uh go ‘head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesn’t always come so instead
it’s okay
you could thank me now
uhh yeah well alright here i go
mahalo from the hardest act to follow
lately i’ve been drinking like there’s a message in a bottle
aloha’s to women with no ties
to men that i know well
that way there are no lies
you could thank me now for all the info i give to you niggas
i’m on the brink of influential
i’m here for you niggas
i guess a hit doesn’t add up to a career for you niggas
i must have been hard to watch
what a year for you niggas
it’s december 31st and we in miami just meditating
you got the resolutions we just got reservations
living out a dream it feels like i stayed up
and we just wanna party patron straight up
fuck that old shit i’m on new things
ovo clique red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all half was never the agreement
who’d thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
i could relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with mike but gotta ai him for your survival
damn i swear sports and music are so synonomous
’cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
yeah so on behalf of the demanded
and the entertainment that you take for granted
you could thank me now
and oh my goodness you’re welcome
you’re welcome
at this point me is who i’m trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and i never know what to tell them
cause they think that i can help them get back to where they fell from
but drink up because everyone here is good tonight
except the niggas that i came with they good for life
yeah thats how you know it’s going down
in case another chance never comes around
uhh shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
i think i’m spending all my time with the wrong women
i think i have a chance at love but knowing me i miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isn’t realistic
man the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones i used to hit her friends now
that make me wish i had a little less mileage on me
but do i ever come up in discussion over double pump latte’s
and low fat muffin’s do i
or is missing what we had outta the question
i’m probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
i got flows for the marilyn monroe’s who’s there before it all
i guess thats how it goes
they hear about your cons or focus on your pro’s
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
but those same ones from your area will grow
into women that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allow
where are they all now
i know there somewhere watching so i’m trying to make them proud
searching for the meaning
you’ll find it next to me
and tell me i’m the highest guess we finally get to see
i’m feeling like nas who am i to disagree
they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
it’s probably why i’m in this bitch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
i rep the atf in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
i’m sorry poolside drinking
margharita rounds
shout out to my city though i hardly be in town
i’m the black sheep but chris farley wears the crown
and i know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
i’m in the world where things are taken never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and i’m aware that this could be the last time you listen
so while i’m still here in this position
let me know let me know ohhh ohhh
let me know let me know
yo this is really one of my dumbest flows ever
i haven’t slept in days and me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways so i’m single
thinking about what we had and missing you
but i ain’t santa i got something for these bad bitches too
i mean paparazzi on me trying not to get caught out
they always seem to catch me with the women that i brought out
baby don’t hold on too long ’cause thats how them stories start out
and all those girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out it’s drizzy
always gone but never hard to find
and since you can’t escape me do i ever cross your mind
because all this shit is new to me i’m learning to behave
and still spending every dollar they encourage me to save but i’m good
i know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
i’m looking forward to the memories of right now
never forgettin’ from where i came
and no matter where i’m headed i promise to stay the same
i’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
ask your girl i’m the realest nigga she been around
when i pull up in something new and park it by the haters
and when you get to talkin’ bout the greatest
i just really hope that 
you’d think of me
im doin my thing 
this just might be my realest flow ever
when i say for life y’all say forever
it’s hard but its fair i told that girl life hurts
the closest you gonna get to this is a pac tshirt
the name’s young baby you know i live that thug life
the good die young so i’mma need a thug wife
yeah i’m talking his and her firearms

no snow tires the rain slipslide like trick daddy and trina
oli north pull in like 10 million a season
queen street visions that nobody believed in

unforgivin times but fuck it i manage
why is my struggle different than others
only child thats takin care of his mother
as health worsens and bills double
thats not respectable all of a sudden
i dont get a pat on the back for the come up
what do you see when you see me
when did all the things i mean
from the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning
maybe i share it with too many people
back then it used to just feel like our secret
back when i would write
and not think about how they receive it
i be tryna manifest the things i needed
and look now i mean its hard to believe it even for me
but youre mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
how they go from not wantin me at all
to wantin to see me lose it all
things get dark but my aura just starts glowin
im overcome with emotions
ones i cant access when im stoned sober
jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
i could only speak what i know of
man we wrote the book on calculated thinkin
and icy heineken drinkin and rival neighborhoods linkin
and puttin your trust in someone
with the risk of financially sinkin
all you did was write the book on garbageass rollies
ego strokin picture postin
claimin that youd do it for motivational purposes only
but you just had to show me
see i know cause i study you closely
i know when someone lyin
i notice people standin for nothin and gettin tired
i know what were both thinkin even when youre quiet
sometimes i gotta just make sure that i didnt lose you
did i did i
did i lose you
did i did i
did i lose you
this is why i do this shit
i think they call this uhm venting
this is me
still the same
they want the hits
i play the game
no auto tune but you can feel the pain
it all comes spilling out like i hit a vein
what up lil braw
what up slum ville
i hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still
the fans thinking that we all signed for one mill
equal opportunities rapping that shit is unreal
that aint how it works
that aint that how it goes
and i be getting high to balance out the lows
and i could use a writer to balance out my flows
but i never share my thoughts
this is all a nigga knows
and every time i try it opens up my eyes
these verses are a chance to remembered and reprised
and i would be performing just as long as im alive
so every word i utter will be mine
dont believe the lies
look me in my eyes
please dont be scared of me
please dont be scared of me
i remember you
this feeling isnt new
so please dont be scared of me
please dont be scared of me
oh oh oh oh oh uhh
i never cried when pac died
but i probably will when hov does
and if my tears hold value then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us
and ill be standing in a puddle
i stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
and ima keep it honest
im so tired of being subtle
its just me forty o and neek standing in a huddle
staring at the members of my team
who get questioned about they profit from this 40 million dollar scheme
just know that im in debt for you defending all our dreams
i hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems
but yall the reason for a lot of my devotion
you know i spend money because spending time is hopeless
and know i pop bottles cause i bottle my emotions
at least i put it all in the open
dont believe the lies
look me in my eyes
please dont be scared of me
please dont be scared of me
i remember you
this feeling isnt new
so please dont be scared of me
please dont be scared of me
oh oh oh oh oh uhh
fuck all yall
we ignore feelings here
premature millionaires
welcome to my realest year
i swear we making a killing here
i should be on top of the world here just chilling here
but its funny having fans
who find you before anybody ever has the chance and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game
and realize when your there sometimes the shit dont feel the same
and plus things are just surreal at home
people think ive changed just because my appeal has grown
and now security follow me everywhere so i never actually am alone i just always feel alone
i think im scared of what the future holds
i was wishing for some things and now am used to those
every girl i meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes
the honesty of my music has left me too exposed
all my old friends think i got a new crowd
and people seem to notice every time i do smile
i guess that mean they come few and far between
even though am living out what you would call the dream
and my uncle aint even messaging me
and him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
i hope this isnt one of those forever things
its funny how money can change everything
dont believe the lies
look me in my eyes
please dont be scared of me
please dont be scared of me
i remember you
this feeling isnt new
so please dont be scared of me
please dont be scared of me
oh oh oh oh oh uhh

the game is all mine and im mighty possessive
lil wayne could not have found him a better successor
every shot you see them take at me they all contested
allen iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question
last night i went to sleep wanting more
tried to decide what direction i should go towards
some nights i wish i could go back in life
not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight wonder whats next for me
longevity wonder how long theyll check for me
prolly forever if i stay in my zone
i speak on this generation but cant change it alone
i heard a little little homie talking reckless in vibe
quite a platform you chose you shoulda kept it inside
oh you tried its so childish calling my name on the world stage
you need to act your age and not your girls age
it gets worse by the annual my careers like a howto manual
so i guess its understandable man
oh you gotta love it you gotta love it cheer
i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get em
to show they outfits off guess they need the attention
i remember when it used to be music that did it
but then again times have changed man who are we kiddin
im managed by my friends that i grew up with
id rather give that 15 to people i fuck with
if me and future hadnt made it with this rappin
we prolly be out in silicon tryna get our billions on
but here we are yeah
lately i feel the haters eatin away at my confidence
they scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
bitches alter my messages like we had words
and stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
bitter women im overtextin are pmsing crazy this year
fuckin with my image
ive been tryna reach the youth so i can save em this year
fuck it i guess i gotta wait til next year
and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
bout how we need protection from those protectin the block
nobody lookin out for nobody
maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
instead of bein somebody that makes the news
so everybody can tweet about it
and then they start to rip about it
and four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
damn i just had to say my piece about it
oh you gotta love it
but they scared of the truth so back to me showin out in public
thats a hotter subject
ive been whippin mercedes and nigga try to budget
i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins
shout out to ashley tasha bianca julia ericka southern america
part of my heritage pardon my arrogance part in my hair again
thats that comeback flow comeback flow
once i start its apparent
im with girl whose ass is so big thats partly embarrassin
but fuck all the blushin and fuck your discussions
and fuck all the judgement
your content so aggressive lately whats irkin you
shit is gettin so personal in your verses too
i wanna prove that im number one over all these niggas
bein number two is just being the first to lose
my city dictated music nobody seein us
winter here already but somehow im heatin up
been observin the game and felt like ive seen enough
lets drop a tape on these niggas then well see whats up
yeah boy you rappin like you seen it all
you rappin like the throne should be the three of yall
best i ever had seems like a decade ago
decadent flow and i still got a decade to go
oh please take it ease wheres the love and the peace
why you rappin like you come from the streets
i got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
and im never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves

i met someone new last night and we kicked it
and im going back there tonight
and you know whats on my mind this time
going back there tonight
and you know whats on my mind
if you had my love
and i gave you all my trust
would you comfort me
and if somehow you knew
that your love would be untrue
would you lie to me
if you had my love
and i gave you all my trust
would you comfort me
and if somehow you knew
that your love would be untrue
would you lie to me
out of body

ill probably selfdestruct if i ever lose but i never do
steady doin double shifts
1da doin the beat and i open up like a double click
more blessings because im generous
thirtyseater plane for like ten of us
remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet
she knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
nowadays when we catchin up we just laugh about it
cant describe what my life is like when she asks about it
scary whenever i close my eyes at night
wakin up to public statements about my private life
i can never sleep til morning on all my quiet nights
but you can rest assure that my mind is right
get no sick days i leave for like three months in six days

get lil updates texts in my inboxes have been poppin
seasons go by like im bingewatchin
went from club palazzo in the bridge to club liv
to not even showin up to a club less we doin bis
i cant even party while a nigga pursuin this
distractions will do you in in the truest sense
especially people that want to lecture me and frame it like they just want the best for me
or they check for me whatever splits it up
so theres more for them and theres less for me
they dont know they got to be faster than me to get to me
no ones done it successfully
7am in germany cant believe that they heard of me
last verse that i gotta do is always like surgery
always tryin to let go of anything thatll burden me
thats the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
last chance i get to make sure that you take it personally
take this shit to heart its always executed perfectly
if we do a song its like takin my kids to work with me
you overnight celebrity you one day star
swear i told you that im in this bitch for eternity
i am a reflection of all of your insecurities
behind closed doors a lot of 6 god worshipping
done talk now cause theres other shit thats concernin me
theres real ones around me
i want to make sure they learn from me
i want to see my dog but his grandmothers his surety
he cant even dip out to see me in an emergency
my life is set around competition and currency
takin summer off cause they tell me i need recovery
maybe gettin back to my regular life will humble me

that tells me my life is too much and then moves to atlanta
damn of all the places you could go
i just thought youd choose somewhere that has somebody that you know
im always up too late i worry bout you there alone
in that place you call your home
warm nights and cold patron
i hope you dont get known for nothing crazy
cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
i know they say the first love is the sweetest
but that first cut is the deepest
i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
secrets you were telling everybody but me
dont be fooled by the money im still just young and unlucky
im surprised you couldnt tell
i was only trying to get ahead
i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
and you looking for a purpose
i was only trying to get ahead
i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous

and really i think i like who i’m becoming
there’s times where i might do it just to do it
like it’s nothing
there’s times when i might blow like 50k on a vacation
for all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
all it took was patience
i got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
the same ones that’ll come up off the hip for me
the realest niggas say “your lyrics do shit for me”
