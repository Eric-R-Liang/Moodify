mandy used to be that girl
the one that never said a word
but she only sang
s club 7 and all those boy bands
now its been a few years
it looks like things have changed
now shes mine and i want to say
mandy always laughs when i act stupid
i am unaware that im a nuisance
with her its never wasted time
mandy always knows exactly what im
thinking and shes always on my mind
and now im never gonna let her go
cause mandy always knows
mandy always tells the truth
even when its hard to do
and she always understands
even when it dont make sense
even though she is the blonde
im the one that feels so dumb
when i have a problem
im sure that mandy knows
when im feeling lonely
im sure that mandy knows
when everythings crazy
shes always there for me
and im sure that she knows
im never ever gonna let her go
she walks away
colors fade to gray
every precious moments now a waste
she hits the gas hoping it would pass
the red lights starts to flash
its time to wait
and black keys never looked so beautiful
and a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull
and the lights out never had this bright a glow
and the black keys
showing me a world i never knew no
a world i never knew
she hates the sun cause it proves shes not alone
and the world doesnt revolve around her soul
she loves the sky cause it validates her pride
never lets them know when she is wrong
and black keys never looked so beautiful
and a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull
and the lights out never had this bright a glow
and the black keys
showing me a world i never knew no
and the walls are closing in
dont let them get inside of your head
dont let them get inside of your head
dont let them get inside of your head
dont let them inside
cause black keys never looked so beautiful
and a perfect rainbow never seemed so dull
and the lights out never had this bright a glow
and the black keys
showing me a world i never knew
dont let them get 
dont let them get
inside of your head 
dont let them get inside of your head
dont let them get 
dont let them get
inside of your head
dont let them get 
inside of your head
sometimes youll find its better black and white
yeahahah
whoaohohoh
no this isnt what i wanted
never thought itd come this far
thinkin back to where we started
and how we lost all that we are
we were young and times were easy
but i could see its not the same
standing here but you dont see me
give it all for that to change
i dont want to lose her
dont want to let her go
standing out in the rain
need to know if its over
cause i would leave you alone
im flooded with all this pain
knowing that ill never hold her
like i did before the storm
yeahahah
before the storm
with every strike of lightning
comes a memory that lasts
not a word is left unspoken
as the thunder starts to crash
maybe i should give up
standing out in the rain
need to know if its over
cause i would leave you alone
im flooded with all this pain
knowing that ill never hold her
like i did before the storm
im trying to keep the lights from going out
and the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
they always say a heart is not a home
without the one who gets you through the storm
standing out in the rain
knowing that its really over
please dont leave me alone
im flooded with all this pain
knowing that ill never hold ya
like i did before the storm
like i did before the storm
this is life in this world
some things go right
some things go wrong
its just how the world can be
people just want to be free
the verdict came in and it said i was guilty
i looked at the judge hey america built me
tried to get rich but they label me filthy
only god can judge me touch me feel me
my friend calls me at 9 oclock
saysget the car its time to rock

how the story would unfold

wrong place wrong time

cause our love wont survive

cause our love wont survive

ive been running races
still dont know what ive been chasing
but my eyes still can see
bluer skies that wait for me
and im on my way
time for me to fly
time for me to soar
time for me to open up my heart and knock on heavens door
time for me to live
its time for me to sing
time for me to lay down all my worries and ill spread my wings
time for me to fly
the earth can be a heavy ride
when the clouds are in your eyes
but i feel a calling
i will rise i wont be falling
and ill escape the gravity
and ill reach my destiny
and ill fly away
time for me to fly
the gates of heaven will open wide
i will be
i will rise
there wont be compromise
as i take to the open skies
i will fly away
i will fly away
i will fly away
i will fly away
i will fly away 
im gunna fly away
i will fly away

two minutes and my heart begins to break
another minute and she makes me feel brand new
thats just three minutes with you
four minutes and shes everything i see
five minutes and shes where i wanna be
another minute everything just feels so new
i need six minutes with you

reaching for her keys so i guess its now or never
i wish that i was on the radio
id sing her favorite song shed be front row at every show
this parties lame and now im running out of time
ive only got six minutes if im gonna make her mine

i never thought that id catch this love bug again
hopeless head over heels in the moment
i never thought that id get hit by this love bug again
i cant get your smile out of my mind
i think about your eyes all the time
youre beautiful but you dont even try
modesty is just so hard to find
now im speechless
over the edge im just breathless
i never thought that id catch this love bug again
hopeless head over heels in the moment
i never thought that id get hit by this love bug again
i kissed her for the first time yesterday
everything i wished that it would be
suddenly i forgot how to speak
hopeless breathless
baby cant you see
now im speechless
over the edge im just breathless
i never thought that id catch this love bug again
now im hopeless head over heels in the moment
i never thought that id get hit by this love bug again
love bug again
