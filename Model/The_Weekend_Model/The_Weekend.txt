i went from starin at the same four walls for 21 years
to seein the whole world in just twelve months
been gone for so long i might have just found god
well probably not if i keep my habits up
probably not if i cant keep up with lovin
i cant stand talkin to brand new girls
only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
probably not if my niggas round them up
probably not if we take em to my spot
probably not if i tweak all day just to sleep at night
god damn im high
my doctor told me to stop
and he gave me something to pop
i mix it up with some adderalls and i wait to get to the top
and i mix it up with some alcohol and i pour it up in a shot
i dont care about you why you worried bout me
all i want is that smoke give me all of that smoke
last week was my rough week im still drippin down from my nose
and i dont know how to drive i make my driver get high
but if he goes under that one time believe my driver gettin fired
and i dont got any friends i got xo in my bloodwork
and im posted up down in florida
lauderdale to that mia
cold drinks grand marnier
to the break of dawn kahlua milk
white russian when the sun hits
white russian with tongue tricks
i like the feeling of your tongue rings
she likes the way my whole tongue flip
she grind hard for tuition
she grind hard til her teeth chip
i make it harder with gold grills
i make her suck with gold grills
in the back room in the vip
she dont ever sleep
this aint nothing to relate to 
even if you tried you tried you tried
you tried you tried you tried
you tried you tried you tried
you tried you tried you tried
when the sun goes up youre searching for a love
so your heart wont lead you to anyone
when the sun goes down i know what you become
you become awake unlike the rest of us
i lay my head on a thousand beds
its been a test to see how far a man can go without himself
i think i lost the only piece that held it all in place
now my madness is the only love i let myself embrace
i couldve stayed
but i chose the life
i chose the life
then i realized
she might have been the one
i let it go
for a little fun
i made a trade
gave away our days
for a little fame
now ill never see your face
but its okay i adapted anyway
adapted to these models
whos adapted to the bottle
they take it down like water
just to burn away their sorrows
ill stay up till tomorrow
just to tear down all their morals
and all is fair in love and war
shes pure so pure like the love thats so uncut and raw
and clean so clean as opposed to what i offered
because i chose the life
i chose the life
then i realized
she might have been the one
i let it go
for a little fun oh
i made a trade
gave away our days
for a little fame
now ill never see your face
but its okay i adapted anyway
she might just be the one 
theres no one inside
but youre free to relax
if you commit to this ride
theres no turning back

there comes a time in a mans life
when he must take responsibility
for the choices he has made
there are certain things that he must do
things that he must say
like i love you
and i need you
i only want you
and nobodys going to know
if its true 
i never thought id feel this kind of hesitation 
my hand on another girl 
i wish i didnt have to lie
i wish i could let you know
cause i love you
and i need you
i only want you
and nobodys going to know if its true
i know you can see through me
valerie 
oh valerie
you just choose to never know
valerie 
why pretend to trust in me
youd rather this than be alone
cause i love you
and i need you
i only want you 
and nobodys going to know if its true
cause i love you 
and i need you 
i only want you 
and nobodys going to know if its true
and i love you 
cause i love you baby
and i need you 
and i need you
i only want you
and nobody gonna know 
they all feel the same
adjust to the fame
cause no one will love you like her
its pointless
like tears in the rain
so now that shes gone
embrace all that come
and die with a smile
dont show the world how alone youve become
when its said and done
i already felt love
and i let it end up
dying by itself
and when its said and done
you were better off
you deserve real love
and i deserve to be by myself
cause ive gone too far
and i started too young
to give up
and even if i changed
it would be too late
i exposed my ways
now every girl i touch
they all feel the same
adjust to the fame
cause no one will love you like her
its pointless
like tears in the rain
so now that shes gone
embrace all that come
and die with a smile
dont show the world how alone youve become
they all feel the same
i shouldve let you leave
but i let you watch me slip away
i couldve set you free
but im selfish
i watched you stay
she has no recollection
of the life she had without me
she let it slip away away away
its so sad it had to be this
she forgot the good things about me
she let it slip away away away
they all feel the same
adjust to the fame
cause no one will love you like her
its pointless
like tears in the rain
so now that shes gone
embrace all that come
and die with a smile
dont show the world how alone youve become
she has no recollection
of the life she had without me
she let it slip away away away
its so sad it had to be this
she forgot the good things about me
she let it slip away away away
i’ll let you show me his moves
let you do what he taught you
let you reminisce how you used to do
girl i’m open to anything that’ll get you into that zone
and understand that we’re all alone
so you can slowly take off your clothes
baby girl you know what’s in store
baby i will stay up all night
and i’ve been goin’ hard since last night
and i’mma go harder tonight
wish you can see you through my eyes
ooh i’m tellin’ you this ain’t the same
and i know he’s still in your brain
i’m ‘bout to burn that shit into flames
once i’m in you

‘cuz baby when i’m finished with ya you won’t wanna go
and i’mma work you like a pro baby
and you gon’ take it like one

girl you could have had me doing anything you pleased
girl you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
cus im not as hard as i make it seem to be
and it could have went so many ways so many ways it can go
cus aint nobody feels the way that i feel when im alone
so if i said that i wont call the lying comes natural to me
you probably could have had it all you could have been that lonely star
if we just went on
if we just went on 
if we just went on
if we just went on
happiness exists when you dont know a thing
so i hope you dont think this song is about you
and only i can know how close you came
but baby im a pro at letting go
i love it when they come and go
but it could have went so many ways so many ways it can go

and every day you learn about yourself
and nothing really played out how its supposed to
depending on somebody elses wealth
but now you know the value of a dollar
and girl i make enough of it to spend

howd you teach teach yourself how to smile
in a world where your dreams cant be real no
every touch that you sell is a lie
i love you love
this love
were professional
i know you know
were sophisticated
at lovin
i know you want your money girl
cause you do this every day okay
