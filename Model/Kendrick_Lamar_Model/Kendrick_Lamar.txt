loves gonna get you killed
but prides gonna be the death of you and you and me
and you and you and you and me
and you and you and you and me
and you and you and you and me and
me i wasnt taught to share but care
me i wasnt taught to share but care
hellraising wheelchasing new worldy possessions
fleshmaking spiritbreaking which one would you lessen
the better part the human heart
you love em or dissect em
happiness or flashiness how do you serve the question
see in the perfect world i would be perfect world
i dont trust people enough beyond they surface world
i dont love people enough to put my faith in men
i put my faith in these lyrics hoping i make amend
i understand i aint perfect
i probably wont come around
this time i might put you down
last time i aint give a fuck i still feel the same now
my feelings might go numb youre dealing with cold thumb
im willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
pity parties and functions and you and yours
a perfect world you probably live another 24
i cant fake humble just cause your ass is insecure
i cant fake humble just cause your ass is insecure
me i wasnt taught to share but care
in another life i surely was there
me i wasnt taught to share but care
maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
now in a perfect world i probably wont be insensitive
cold as december but never remember what winter did
i wouldnt blame you for mistakes i made or the bed i laid
seems like i point the finger just to make a point nowadays
smiles and cold stares the temperature goes there
indigenous disposition feel like we belong here
i know the walls they can listen i wish they could talk back
the hurt becomes repetition the love almost lost that
sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
a perfect world is never perfect only filled with lies
promises are broken and more resentment come alive
race barriers make inferior of you and i
see in a perfect world ill choose faith over riches
ill choose work over bitches ill make schools out of prison
ill take all the religions and put em all in one service
just to tell em we aint shit but hes been perfect world
me i wasnt taught to share but care
me i wasnt taught to share but care
maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
it was always me vs the world
until i found its me vs me
why why why why
why why why why
just remember what happens on earth stays on earth
we gon put it in reverse
darling i told you many times
and i am telling you once again
just to remind you sweetheart
oh lamar hail mary and marijuana times is hard
pray with the hooligans shadows all in the dark
fellowship with demons and relatives im a star
life is one funny mothafucka
a true comedian you gotta love him you gotta trust him
i might be buggin infomercials and no sleep
introverted by my thoughts
children listen it gets deep
see once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects
the object was to process and digest povertys dialect
adaptation inevitable
gun violence crack spot
federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
anthony was the oldest of seven
wellrespected calm and collected
laughin and jokin made life easier
hard times momma on crack
a fouryearold tellin his nanny he needed her
his family history
pimpin and bangin
he was meant to be dangerous
clocked him a grip and start slangin
fifteen scrapin up his jeans with quarter pieces
even got some head from a smoker last weekend
dodged a policeman workin for his big homie
smalltime hustler graduated to a brick on him
10000 dollars out of a project housing thats on the daily
seen his first mil twenty years old had a couple of babies
had a couple of shooters
caught a murder case fingerprints on the gun they assumin
but witnesses couldnt prove it
that was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
he beat the case and went back to hustlin
birdshufflin anthony rang
the first in the projects with the twotone mustang
0 thing they say 50 came
circlin parking lots and parking spots
and hoppin out while harrassin the corner blocks
crooked cops told anthony he should kick it
he brushed em off and walked back to the kentucky fried chicken
see at this chicken spot
there was a lightskinned nigga that talked a lot
with a curly top and a gap in his teeth
he worked the window his name was ducky
he came from the streets the robert taylor homes
southside projects chiraq the terror dome
drove to california with a woman on him and 500 dollars
they had a son hopin that hed see college
hustlin on the side with a ninetofive to freak it
cadillac seville hed ride his son around on weekends
threepiece special with his name on the shirt pocket
cross the street from the projects anthony planned to rob it
stuck up the place before back in 84
thats when affiliation was really eight gears of war
so many relatives tellin us sellin us devilish works
killin us crime intelligent felonious
prevalent proposition with 9s
ducky was wellaware
they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
he figured hed get on these niggas good sides
free chicken every time anthony posted in line
two extra biscuits anthony liked him and then let him slide
they didnt kill him
in fact it look like theyre the last to survive
pay attention that one decision changed both of they lives
one curse at a time
reverse the manifest and good karma and ill tell you why
you take two strangers and put em in random predicaments
give em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
twenty years later them same strangers you make em meet again
inside recording studios where they reapin their benefits
then you start remindin them about that chicken incident
whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence
because if anthony killed ducky top dawg could be servin life
while i grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
so i was takin a walk the other day…
aye i remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances

i used to be jealous of aaron afflalo
i used to be jealous of aaron afflalo
he was the one to follow
he was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
he would live in the gym
we was living in sorrow
total envy of him
he made a dream become a reality
actually making it possible to swim
his way out of compton with further more to accomplish
graduate with honors a sponsor of basketball scholars
its 2004 and im watching him score 30
remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
that we was just moving backwards
the bungalow where you find us
the art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
stick my head inside the study hall he focused on math
determination ambition plus dedication and wisdom
qualities he was given was the shit we didnt have
dug inside of his book bag and coach palmer asked for his finals
he had his back like a spinal meanwhile
we singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
he focused on the nba we focused on some patron
now watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy fly
watch that black boy fly
black boy
i used to jealous of jayceon
i used to jealous of jayceon  taylor when i was young
taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
a buick had driven past bumping him when i mowed the lawn
money laundering hustling homies pondering up against
schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
wars the case and just in case you wasnt alarmed
the city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
its 2004 and im hearing the people roar
for the name of the game they line in front of the store
swap meets selling our mixtapes im like oh shit wait
dont wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
mixed feelings was my opinion i was defending my insecurities
chillin my conscience next to a villain
compton made you believe success wasnt real
be honest none of us knew of a record deal
so as i peel through these lottery tickets
i see a harley davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
a tall nigga hopped out with jordans and a white tank top
he was top of the rap game we was the top of the block
so watch that black boy fly
my mama didnt raise me up to be jealoushearted
like most of the winners call it
regardless of where you stay hold your head and continue marching
thats what she said but in my head i wanted to be like jordan
a boy touring the country with money from mic recording
the only way out the ghetto you know the stereotype
shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
and shortly i got discouraged
like every time i walked to the corner had them guns bursting
nigga i was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
only one in a million will ever see better days
especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
all these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
they all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
what am i to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
when 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggas making it out thats mission impossible
so i never believed the type of performance that i could do
i wasnt jealous cuz of the talents they got
i was terrified theyll be the last black boys to fly
out of compton
thank god
black boy fly watch that black boy fly

when i was 27 i grew accustomed to more fear
accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
my newfound life made all of me magnified
how many accolades do i need to block denial
the shock value of my success put bolts in me
all this money is god playin a joke on me
is it for the moment and will he see me as job
take it from me and leave me worse than i was before
at 27 my biggest fear was losin it all
scared to spend money had me sleepin from hall to hall
scared to go back to section 8 with my mama stressin
30 shows a month and i still wont buy me no lexus
what is an advisor somebody thats holdin my checks
just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt
i read a case about rihannas accountant and wondered
how did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers
the type of shitll make me flip out
and just kill somethin drill somethin
get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin
i practiced runnin from fear guess i had some good luck
at 27 years old my biggest fear was bein judged
how they look at me reflect on myself my family my city
what they say bout me reveal
if my reputation would miss me
what they see from me
would trickle down generations in time
what they hear from me
would make em highlight my simplest lines
im talkin fear fear of losin creativity
im talkin fear fear of missin out on you and me
im talkin fear fear of losin loyalty from pride
cause my dna wont let me involve in the light of god
im talkin fear fear that my humbleness is gone
im talkin fear fear that love aint livin here no more
im talkin fear fear that its wickedness or weakness
fear whatever it is both is distinctive
fear what happens on earth stays on earth
and i cant take these feelings with me
so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
searchin for resolutions until somebody get back
fear what happens on earth stays on earth
and i cant take these feelings with me
so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
wonderin if im livin through fear or livin through rap
goddamn you
goddamn me
goddamn us
goddamn we
goddamn us all
verse two says you only have i known of all the families of the earth therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities
so until we come back to these commandments until you come back to these commandments were gonna feel this way were gonna be under this curse
because he said hes gonna punish us the socalled blacks hispanics and native american indians are the true children of israel
we are the israelites according to the bible
the children of israel hes gonna punish us for our iniquities for our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods that arent his son so the lord thy god chasten thee
so just like you chasten your own son hes gonna chastise you because he loves you
so thats why we get chastised thats why were in the position were in
until we come back to these laws statutes and commandments and do what the lord said these curses are gonna be upon us
were gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today in the united states of america

pardon my residence
came from the bottom of mankind
my hair is nappy my dick is big my nose is round and wide
you hate me dont you
you hate my people your plan is to terminate my culture
youre fuckin evil i want you to recognize that im a proud monkey
you vandalize my perception but cant take style from me
and this is more than confession
i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion
im guardin my feelins i know that you feel it
you sabotage my community makin a killin
you made me a killer emancipation of a real nigga
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice

and man a say they put me in a chain cah we black
imagine now big gold chain full of rocks
how you no see the whip left scars pon me back
but now we have a big whip parked pon the block
all them say we doomed from the start cah we black

im the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean its evident that im irrelevant to society
thats what youre telling me penitentiary would only hire me
curse me till im dead
church me with your fake prophesyzing that imma be just another slave in my head
institutionalize manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me dont you

or tell georgia state marcus garvey got all the answers
or try to celebrate february like its my bday
or eat watermelon chicken and koolaid on weekdays

or watch bet cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street

my innocence limited the experience lacked
ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer but i did it in fact

gamblin benjamin benefits sittin in traffic
spinnin women in cartwheels linen fabric on fashion
winnin in every decision

the day i came home

runnin home and the man and woman that crossed him
sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted

i remember you was conflicted misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
if these walls could talk 
sex she just want to close her eyes and sway
if you if you if you exercise your right to work it out
its true its true its true shout out to the birthday girls say hey
say hey everyone deserves a night to play
and shes plays only when you tell her no
if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when i’m in it i love it when i’m in it
if these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
no boat i float better than he would
no life jacket i’m not the guard in nazareth
but your flood can be misunderstood
wall telling me they full of pain resentment
need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
me i’m just a tenant
my lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
these walls are vulnerable exclamation
interior pink color coordinated
i interrogated every nook and cranny
i mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
these walls want to cry tears
these walls happier when i’m here
these walls never could hold up
everytime i come around demolition might crush
if these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
yelling at me continuously i can see
your defense mechanism is my decision
knock these walls down that’s my religion
walls feeling like they ready to close in
i suffocate then catch my second wind
i resonate in these walls
i don’t know how long i can wait in these walls
i’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
they sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
i beg to differ i must’ve missed them
i’m not involved i’d rather diss them
i’d rather call all you put your wall up
cause when i come around demolition gon’ crush
if your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late
your destiny accepted your fate
burn accessories and stash them where they are
take the recipe the bible and god
wall telling you that commissary is low
race wars happening no calling co
no calling your mother to save you
homies say to you youre reputable not acceptable
your behavior is sammy da bull like a killer that turned snitch
walls is telling me you a bitch
you pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them
that sentence so important
walls telling you to listen to sing about me
retaliation is strong you even dream about me
killed my homeboy and god spared your life
dumb criminal got indicted the same night
so when you play this song rewind the first verse
about me abusing my power so you can hurt
about me and her in the shower whenever she horny
about me and her in the after hours of the morning
about her baby daddy currently serving life
and how she think about you until we meet up at night
about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
and how she fucking on a famous rapper
walls could talk
i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in a hotel room
when the four corners of this cocoon collide
you’ll slip through the cracks hoping that you’ll survive
gather your wind take a deep look inside
are you really who they idolize
to pimp a butterfly
at first i did love you
but now i just wanna fuck
late night thinkin of you
until i got my nut
tossed and turned lesson learned
you was my first girlfriend
bridges burned all across the board
destroyed but what for
when i get signed homie imma act a fool
hit the dance floor strobe lights in the room
snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
imma buy a brand new caddy on fours
trunk the hood up two times deuce four
platinum on everything platinum on wedding ring
married to the game made a bad bitch yours
when i get signed homie imma buy a strap
straight from the cia set it on my lap
take a few m16s to the hood
pass em all out on the block whats good
imma put the compton swap meet by the white house
republican run up get socked out
hit the press with a cuban link on my neck
uneducated but i got a million dollar check like that
we should never gave we should never gave
niggas money go back home money go back home
yo whats up its dre
remember the first time you came out to the house
you said you wanted a spot like mine
but remember anybody can get it
the hard part is keeping it motherfucker
what you want you a house or a car
forty acres and a mule a piano a guitar
anything see my name is uncle sam on your dollar
motherfucker you can live at the mall
i know your kind 
thats why im kind
dont have receipts 
oh man thats fine
pay me later wear those gators
cliche and say fuck your haters
i can see the borrow in you
i can see the dollar in you
little white lies with a snow white collar in you
but its whatever though because im still followin you
because you make me feel forever baby count it all together baby
then hit the register and make me feel better baby
your horoscope is a gemini two sides
so you better cop everything two times
two coupes two chains two cnotes

ill tell you my hypothesis im probably just way too loyal
k dizzle would do it for you my niggas think im a god
truthfully all of em spoiled usually youre never charged
but somethin came over you once i took you to the fuckin bet awards
you lookin at artists like the harvests

somebody told me you thinkin bout snatchin jewelry
i shouldve listened what my grandmama said to me
shit dont change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
shit dont change until you get up and wash your ass
shit dont change until you get up and wash your ass nigga

and once upon a time in a city so divine
called west side compton there stood a little nigga
he was 5 foot something god bless the kid
took his homie to the show and this is what they said
what im sposed to do when im lookin at walkin licks
the convicts talk bout matchin money and foreign whips
the private jets and passports presidential glass floor
gold bottles gold models sniffin up the ass for

not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin on your brain
it was me l boog and yan yan yg lucky ride down rosecrans
it got ugly wavin yo hand out the window – check yourself
uh warriors and conans hope euphoria can slow dance
with society the driver seat the first one to get killed
seen a lightskinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where beep hang out
now this is not a tape recorder sayin that he did it
but ever since that day i was lookin at him different
that was back when i was nine joey packed the nine
pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
pack a van with four guns at a time
with the sliding door fuck is up
fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up you fuckin punk
pickin up the fuckin pump pickin off you suckers
suck a dick or die or sucker punch
a wall of bullets comin from aks ars ayy yall duck
thats what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
aw man goddamn all hell broke loose
you killed my cousin back in 94 fuck yo truce
now crawl your head in that noose
you wind up dead on the news
aint no peace treaty just pieces bgs up to preapprove
bodies on top of bodies ivs on top of ivs
obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
make sure youre corporate or theyll be callin your mother collect
they say the governor collect all of our taxes except
when we in traffic and tragic happens that shit aint no threat
you movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial i guess
man down where you from nigga
fuck who you know where you from my nigga
where your grandma stay huh my nigga
d city i run my nigga

gyeah real simple and plain
let me teach you some lessons about the street
it aint nothin but a compton thang
gyeah how we do
fresh outta school cause i was a high school grad
sleepin in the living room of my mommas pad
reality struck i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leavin
in fact i got fired cause i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foamin at the mouth
i was straight tweakin the next weekend we broke even
i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin
you know the reasons but still will never know my life
kendrick a
comptons human sacrifice
gyeah cocaine weed
niggas been mixin shit since the 80s loc
sherm sticks buttnakeds
dip make a nigga flip
cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one times crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra rosecrans bullis its compton
im still in the hood loc yeah thats cool
shit the hood took me under so i follow the rules
but yeah thats like me i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doin the same thang
pass it to the left so i can smoke on me
a couple drivebys in the hood lately

shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave
mount up regulators in the whip
down the boulevard with the pistol grip

so loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real
deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
and a bird and ten grands where a mothafucka stand
if i told you i killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
or see me to be innocent kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now and laters to eat
if i mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
would you say my intelligence now is great relief
and its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of bein a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
kill em all if they gossip
the children of the corn they vandalizin the option
of livin a lie drown their body with toxins
constantly drinkin and drive
hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
listen coward the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
out that bitch with deposit a price on his head the tithes
probably go to the projects i
live inside the belly of the rough compton usa

i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i woke up this morning and figured id call you
in case im not here tomorrow
im hoping that i can borrow a piece of mind
im behind on whats really important
my mind is really distorted
i find nothing but trouble in my life
im fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction
or a reaction of what we consider madness
i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright
and a fight he tried to put up but the type
of bullet that stuck had went against his will
as blood spilled on your hands
my plans rather vindictive
everybodys a victim in my eyes
when i ride its a murderous rhythm
and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering get em
i got em and i aint give a fuck
that same mentality i told my brother not to duck
in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if ill ever discover
a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a youngn
in pajamas and duntaduns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
dumb niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child
im proud and well devoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever im a push it wherever whenever
and i love you cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop i hope 
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it section
80 the message resemble brendas got a baby
whats crazy was i was hearin about it
but doubted your ignorance how could you ever
just put her on blast and shit
judging her past and shit
well its completely my future
a nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
and im a need that 40 dollars even if i gotta
fuck suck and swallow in the parking lot
gonzales park im followed by a married man a father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with es
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes i run away and never do miss em
see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back
to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet a leader
you need her to learn something then you probably need to beat her
thats how i was taught
three niggas in one room first time i was tossed
and im exhausted
but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
my sister died in vain but what point are you trying to gain
if you cant fit the pumps i walk in
ill wait
your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song
cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great
a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight
ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
ill never fade away ill never fade away
i know my fate and im on the grind for this cake
im a get or die trying im eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
you lying to these motherfuckers talking about you can help with my story
you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga this bullshit
when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself
am i really scared of passing away
if its today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
rake in the cent of a reaper ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon
and if im doomed may the wound
help me mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot
and every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
i tie my stomach in knots
and im sure not why im infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about
cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe cause im dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the scheme of wondering when im a rest
and youre right your brother was a brother to me
and your sisters situation was the one that put me
in a direction to speak of something thats realer than the tv screen
by any means wasnt trying to offend or come between
her personal life i was like it need to be told
cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul
exactly would have happened if i hadnt continued rappin
or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
fives i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong
fighting for your rights even when youre wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when im gone
now am i worth it
did i put enough work in
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off
and its my turn to settle down
my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
tired of running

over the city with vanity with the music louder
the same song
a black flower

to this true mothafuckin story told by kendrick lamar on rosecrans
smoking on the finest dope aye aye aye aye
drank until i cant no more aye aye aye aye
really im a sober soul but im with the homies right now
and we aint asking for no favors
rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later aye aye aye aye
really im a peacemaker but im with the homies right now
and momma used to say
one day its gon burn you out
one day its gon burn you out out
one day its gon burn you out
one day its gon burn you
but im with the homies right now
me and my niggas four deep in a white toyota
a quarter tank of gas one pistol and orange soda
janky stash box when the federales roll up
basketball shorts with the gonzales park odor
we on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
i hope the universe love you today
‘cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
a flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
if it’s necessary
bumping jeezy first album looking distracted
speaking language only we know you think is an accent
the windows roll down all i see is a hand pass it
hotboxing like george foreman grilling the masses
of the working world we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
and asked them what they working with – look at me
i got the blunt in my mouth
usually i’m drugfree but shit i’m with the homies
come through and bust ya head nigga
me and the homies
where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
me and the homies

hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
i’ll tell you to suck my dick then ill continue eating
we speeding on the 405 passing westchester
you know the light skin girls in all the little dresses good lord
they knew we weren’t from ‘round there
‘cause every time we down there we pulling out the boost mobile sim cards
bougie bitches with no extensions
hood niggas with bad intentions the perfect combination
before we sparked a conversation
we seen three niggas in colors we didn’t like then started interrogating
i never was a gangbanger i mean i was never stranger to the folk neither
i really doubt it
rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
that’s ironic ‘cause i’ve never been violent until i’m with the homies
me and the homies
me and the homies
me and the homies
bragging ‘bout the episode we just had
a shot of hennessey didn’t make me feel that bad
i’m usually a true firm believer of bad karma
consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
we tryna conquer the city with disobedience
quick to turn it up even if we ain’t got the cd in
but jeezy still playing and our attitude is still “nigga what is you saying”

had the coast on standby
dot what up i heard they opened up pandora’s box”
i box ‘em all in by a landslide
nah homie we too sensitive it spill out to the streets
i make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
but i resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with jay
he said its funny how one verse could fuck up the game
i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in a hotel room
i didnt want to selfdestruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didnt stop survivors guilt
going back and forth
trying to convince my self the stripes i earned
or maybe how a1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting
a continuous war back in the city
i was entering a new one
how much a dollar really cost
the question is detrimental paralyzin my thoughts
parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling yall
gotta see how i’m chillin once i park this luxury car
hopping out feeling big as mutombo
20 on pump 6 dirty marcellus called me dumbo
20 years ago cant forget
now i can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals
tenfold the liberal concept of what menll do
20 on 6 he didnt hear me
indigenous african only spoke zulu
my american tongue was slurry
walked out the gas station
a homeless man with a semitan complexion
asked me for 10 rand 
apprrox 1 usd stressin about dry land
deep water powder blue skies that crack open
a piece of crack that he wanted i knew he was smokin
he begged and pleaded
asked me to feed him twice i didnt believe it
told him beat it
contributin money just for his pipe i couldnt see it
he said my son temptation is one thing that ive defeated
listen to me i want a single bill from you
nothin less nothin more
i told him i aint have it and closed my door
tell me how much a dollar cost
its more to feed your mind
water sun and love the one you love
all you need the air you breathe
hes starin at me in disbelief
my temper is buildin hes starin at me i grab my key
hes starin at me i started the car then i tried to leave
and somethin told me to keep it in park until i could see
the reason why he was mad at a stranger
like i was supposed to save him
like im the reason hes homeless and askin me for a favor
hes starin at me his eyes followed me with no laser
hes starin at me i notice that his stare is contagious
cause now im starin back at him feelin some type of disrespect
if i could throw a bat at him itd be aimin at his neck
i never understood someone beggin for goods
askin for handouts takin it if they could
and this particular person just had it down pat
starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
have you ever opened up exodus 14
a humble man is all that we ever need
tell me how much a dollar cost
guilt trippin and feelin resentment
i never met a transient that demanded attention
they got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin
sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
i should distance myself i should keep it relentless
my selfishness is what got me here who the fuck im kiddin
so imma tell you like i told the last bum
crumbs and pennies i need all of mines
and i recognize this type of panhandlin all the time
i got better judgement i know when niggas hustlin keep in mind
when i was strugglin i did compromise now i comprehend
i smell grandpas old medicine reekin from your skin
moonshine and gin nigga youre babblin your words aint flatterin
im imaginin denzel but lookin at oneal
kazaam is sad thrills your gimmick is mediocre
the jig is up i seen you from a mile away losin focus
and im insensitive and i lack empathy
he looked at me and said your potential is bittersweet
i looked at him and said every nickel is mines to keep
he looked at me and said know the truth itll set you free
youre lookin at the messiah the son of jehovah the higher power
the choir that spoke the word the holy spirit
the nerve of nazareth and ill tell you just how much a dollar cost
the price of having a spot in heaven embrace your loss i am god
i wash my hands i said my grace
what more do you want from me
tears of a clown guess im not all what is meant to be
shades of grey will never change if i condone
turn this page help me change so right my wrongs

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby
look inside these walls and you see im havin withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
track attire just tell you im tired and ran away
i should ask a choir
what do you require
to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
as the record spin i should pray
for the record i recognize that im easily prey
i got ate alive yesterday
i got animosity buildin its probly big as a buildin
me jumpin off of the roof is me just playin it safe
but what am i posed to do when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that i aint
but know im accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
and live in the street with rank
no better picture to paint than me walkin from bible study
and called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
from a function that tooken place they was wonderin if i bang
step on my neck and get blood on your nike checks
i dont mind cause one day youll respect
the good kid m
mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby
all i see is strobe lights blindin me in my hindsight
findin me by myself promise me you can help
in all honesty i got time to be copacetic until
you had finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
i can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignorin my purpose to persevere
as a better person
i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i posed to do when the blinkin of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
and you ask
lift up your shirt because you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
i heard em chatter
hes probly young but i know that hes down
step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest
he dont mind he know well never respect
the good kid m
mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby
all i see in this room
20s xannies and these shrooms
grownup candy for pain can we live in a sane
society its entirely stressful upon my brain
you hired me as a victim i quietly hope for change
when violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
the silence in this room with 20s xannies and shrooms
some grownup candy i lost it i feel its nothin to lose
the streets sure to release the worst side of my best
dont mind cause now you ever in debt to good kid m
mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby
1 2 3 go
waking up in a dream
sleepwalking on another big stage
you never heard peace til you hear people scream
your name and your song im so far away
from the place i used to be struggling usually
look at the newer me fate pursuing me
i can feel the energy in the air
it feel like im supposed to be here
everywhere i go im getting so much love
fans the stars everyone
sayin how they cant wait for the lp
and im gonna blow
they believe in me
feel so good in what you do
helps somebody else get through
thats why i do the best i can
because i know how blessed i am
im so high i can touch the sky
i know its my time
and its now or never
shine so bright i light the night
and it feels so right aint nothing better
a fool if i take it all for granted
a smart man if i keep my feet planted
to the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
you speakin outlandish
im a show you how to make it all work
another plan it a short term goal for me
a record sold for me
its just more of me in your ear
for you to hear kendrick persevere
defenses i feel relentless
ambition with a clear vision
takin off i aint takin off these pistons
im takin off on the inner me  youre distance
came across me how much ita cost me
to get you out my business
i set a plan its a short term goal no sky is the limit
im past that now pass that
award not one but four
times two plus yours
i see myself performing there 
sold out shows where the room is packed
sitting at the grammys winning five awards
see myself on big billboards
traveling around the world with endorsement deals
cant imagine how it feels
thats why im smiling everyday
because my dream aint far away
im so high i can touch the sky
i know its my time
and its now or never
shine so bright i light the night
and it feels so right aint nothing better
you looking at me and you tell me im blessed
calculated my steps my heart my breath
breathe hums of a victory and vividly
you see me when at my best my worst
this verse dedicated to the days that i slept
with a curse research my paid dues im reimbursed
i burst in the crowd with a voice and crown
im a king on the prowl and i see mama smile
and i vow on the tape that ill never break
you can break bread with me now
we can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
and walked that mile
in the darkness i often sit back
and get lost in the rap that i wrote
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
i was talking to you
i was walking it through every ghetto
tell success hello
and im so happy i cry
cause i cant believe
all the things i ever wanted
are finally happening for me
and its so surreal
that i almost feel
that any minute i can wake up
from this fantasy
when you pray so hard
and youve come so far
and you know that its the time for you lift your bar
and im gonna do it
watch me
im so high i can touch the sky
i know its my time
and its now or never
shine so bright i light the night
and it feels so right aint nothing better
lord god i come to you a sinner
and i humbly repent for my sins
i believe that jesus is lord
i believe that you raised him from the dead
i will ask that jesus will come to my life
and be my lord and savior
i receive jesus to take control of my life
and that i may live for him from this day forth
thank you lord jesus for saving me with your precious blood
in jesus name amen

and with that being said my nigga let me ask this question
when shit hit the fan is you still a fan

as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and if you riding with me nigga let me ask this question nigga
i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in the hotel room
i didnt wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didnt stop survivors guilt
going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how a1 my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one
a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned
the word was respect
just because you wore a different gang color than mines
doesnt mean i cant respect you as a black man
forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
but i dont know im no mortal man maybe im just another nigga
shit and thats all i wrote
i was gonna call it
another nigga but it aint really a poem i just felt like its
something you probably could relate to
other than that now that i
finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a
certain situa about a metaphor actually you spoke on the ground
what you mean bout that what the ground represent
the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
thats how i see it my word is bond
i see  and
the ground is the symbol for the poor people the poor people is gonna
open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people
cause the rich
people gonna be so fat they gonna be so appetising you know what im
saying wealthy appetising
the poor gonna be so poor and hungry you
know what im saying its gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism
out this mutha they might eat the rich
so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody thats
rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities
see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of
the word
i took nothin i took the opportunities i worked at the most
menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where
i owned it
i went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the
person that works my management company
i changed everything i realized
my destiny in a matter of five years you know what im saying i made
myself a millionaire
i made millions for a lot of people now its time
to make millions for myself you know what im saying
i made millions
for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now
i make millions for us
and through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity
my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good
things come to those that stay true
you know what im saying and it
was happening to me for a reason you know what im saying i was
noticing shit i was
punching the right buttons and it was happening
so its no problem you
know i mean its a problem but im not finna let them know
im finna
go straight through
would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall
i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been threatened
with resistance its been met with resistance
and not only me but it
goes down my family tree
you know what im saying its in my veins to
fight back
aight well how long you think it
take before niggas be like we fighting a war im fighting a war i
cant win and i wanna lay it all down
in this country a
black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and
thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong or while
you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back
once you turn 30 its like they take the heart and soul out of a man
out of a black man in this country
and you dont wanna fight no more
and if you dont believe me you can look around you dont see no loud
mouth 30year old muthafuckas
thats crazy
because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind i
can truly tell you that theres nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted
to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today
i think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores and next time its a riot theres gonna be like uh bloodshed for real
i dont think america
know that
i think american think we was just playing and its gonna be
some more playing but it aint gonna be no playing
its gonna be
murder you know what im saying its gonna be like nat turner 1831
up in this muthafucka
you know what im saying its gonna happen
crazy man
in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music
and vibrations lotta people dont understand how important it is
sometimes i be like get behind a mic and i dont know what type of
energy imma push out or where it comes from
trip me out sometimes
because the spirits we aint even really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
i wanted to read one last thing to you
its actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world
the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city
while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly
the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar
having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as
weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
he can no longer see past his own thoughts
hes trapped
when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
the result
wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same
whats your perspective on that
i do what i wanna do
i say what i wanna say
when i feel and i
look in the mirror and know im there
with my hands in the air
im proud to say yea
im real im real im really really real 
i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they tell
sweet lullabies that come with a smell
of a dozen roses flippin down the green hill
you living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a never relay a guarantee
and plan c never could say just what it was
and your plans only can pan around love
you love him you love them you love her
you love so much you love when love hurts
you love redbottom and gold they say queen
you love handbag on the waist of your jean
you love french tip and trip that pay for
you love bank slip that tell you we paid more
you love a good hand whenever the card dealt
but what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself
i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they fell
out the sky and your optics turn stale
where they mow thats green
i can see you fit the bill
of living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a only can make another mistake
and you cant see success coming from plan c
when it all breaks you you still say you love me
and love them and love when you love her
you love so much you love when love hurts
you love fast cars and their present is old
you love fast women
you love keepin control
of everything you love you love beef
you love streets you love runnin duckin police
you love your hood might even love it to death
but what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself
the reason why i know you very well
cause we have the same eyes cant you tell
the days i tried to cover up and conceal
my pride it only made it harder for me to deal
when living in a world that come with plan b
a scapegoat cause plan a dont come for free
and plan c just an excuse like because
or the word but but what if i got love
i love them i love when i love her
i love so much i love when love hurts
i love first verse cause youre the girl i attract
i love second verse cause your the homie they packed
burning like a stove top they love cooking from scratch
i love what the both of you have to offer
in fact i love it so much
i dont love anything else
but what love got to do with it when i dont love myself
to the point i should hate everything i do love
should i hate living my life inside the club
should i hate her for watching me for that reason
should i hate him for telling me that im season
should i hate them for telling me ball out
should i hate street credibility im talkin about
hatin all money power respect in my will
im hatin the fact that none of that shit make me real
i aint trippin off that dominos anymore just calling sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy but dont learn the hard way like i did homie
any nigga can kill a man that dont make you a real nigga
realness is responsibility realness is taking care of your motherfucking family realness is god nigga
alright thats all i wanted to tell you just make sure you call us back when you get this message
here go your mom
boy you better have my jawn on full all this time you done had my damn car but look i aint tripping
look the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by the food for less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now thats what yall need
oh and top dawg called the house too
i guess they want you and dave to come to the studio
but look you take this music business serious and put out something me and your dad can step to
shit you know we from chicago you know thats what we do
sing my song its all for you 
if i dont hear from you by tomorrow
i hope you come back and learn from your mistakes
come back a man tell your story to these black and brown kids in compton
let em know you was just like them but you still rose from that dark place of violence becoming a positive person
but when you do make it give back with your words of encouragement and thats the best way to give back
to your city
